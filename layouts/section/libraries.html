    <p>
      KiCad libraries are community contributed and available for download on <a href="https://github.com/kicad">GitHub</a>. If you wish to contribute to the libraries, refer to the <a href="/contribute/libraries">contribution guide</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Latest Libraries</h2>
    <p>The latest complete set of official KiCad libraries are available as Git repositories at the following links. Each library set can also be downloaded as a compressed archive, for users who do not wish to use Git.</p>

    {{ partial "github_lib_table.html" . }}

    <p>
    Users who wish to keep their libraries up to date with the latest additions should <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/">clone</a> the library repositories using Git. Using Git means that only the <i>changes</i> to the library need to be retrieved, and significantly reduces download bandwidth.
    </p>
    <h2>Stable Library Releases</h2>

    <p>
    The libraries are periodically compiled into stable <i>releases</i> which can be downloaded from the links below.
    </p>

    Currently schematic symbols are grouped in libraries which are sets of two
    files, one named with *.lib* extension and another with *.dcm*. Libraries are
    generally named in such a way that it describes the symbols it stores, in other words, by
    category. KiCad Library Editor should be used to edit symbols, however, alternatively,
    files can be edited using a text editor because they are human readable. The libraries
    can be found at https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-library[kicad-library] repository.

    On the other hand, footprints are placed in multiple repositories which have their names
    suffixed with *.pretty*. Similarly to symbol libraries, repository names
    indicate the footprints category. Inside the repository, each footprint has its
    own file whose name ends up with *.kicad_mod* extension. Like symbol library files,
    *.kicad_mod* files are human readable and can be edited manually, nevertheless it is
    recommended to use PCB footprint editor to edit/re-save files.
