brief = "General footprint naming conventions"
+++

Each footprint is a `.kicad_mod` file (stored within a `.pretty` directory). The naming convention for a given footprint depends largely on the _type_ of footprint, however a general guide is presented below:

. Specific package type is written first, e.g.
  * `QFN` - Quad Flat No-Lead package
  * `C` - Capacitor
. Package name and number of pins are separated by a hyphen
  * `TO-90`
  * `QFN-48`
  * `DIP-20`
. Unique _fields_ (parameters) in the footprint name are separated by `_` character.
. Package dimensions are specified as `length`x`width` (and optionally `height`) with the prefix `B`
  * `B3.5x0.2mm` - 3.5mm x 0.2mm
  * `B1x1in` - 1inch x 1inch
. Pitch is specified with a leading `P`:
  * `P1.27mm` - 1.27mm pitch
  * `P5.0mm` - 5.0mm pitch
. Orientation e.g. `Horizontal`, `Vertical`
. Any modification to the original footprint, indicated by appending the reason
  * `_HandSoldering`
  * `_ThermalPad`
