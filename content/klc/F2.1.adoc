brief = "General footprint naming conventions"
+++

Each footprint is a `.kicad_mod` file (stored within a `.pretty` directory). The naming convention for a given footprint depends on the _type_ of footprint, however a general guide is presented below:

1. Library naming should not be unnecessarily duplicated in footprint name
1. Specific package type is written first, e.g.
  * `QFN` - Quad Flat No-Lead package
  * `C` - Capacitor
1. Package name and number of pins are separated by a hyphen
  * `TO-90`
  * `QFN-48`
  * `DIP-20`
1. Unique _fields_ (parameters) in the footprint name are separated by `_` character.
1. Package dimensions are specified as `width`x`height`, and are in `mm` units unless explicity specified otherwise:
  * `3.5x0.2` - 3.5mm x 0.2mm
  * `1x1in` - 1inch x 1inch
1. Pitch is specified in `mm` with a leading `P`:
  * `P1.27` - 1.27mm pitch
  * `P5.0` - 5.0mm pitch
1. Orientation e.g. `Horizontal`, `Angled`
1. Any modification to the original footprint, indicated by appending the reason
  * `_HandSoldering`
  * `_ThermalPad`
