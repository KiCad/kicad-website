brief = "Pad requirements for SMD footprints"
+++

Surface mount pads have specific requirements for PCB design.

1. By default, pads for SMD footprints should use only the following layers
.. `F.Cu` - Front copper
.. `F.Mask` - Front soldermask
.. `F.Paste` - Front solderpaste (stencil openings)

[start = 2]
1. Pads with specific stencil aperture design requirements

Some components have specific design requirements for solderpaste (stencil) design. These requirements are often found in the footprint datasheet or an associated technical document.

Most often, custom stencil openings are required for the exposed pads on large IC packages to reduce the amount of solderpaste that is applied during stencil application.

The image below shows an example stencil design found in a footprint datasheet. The superimposed blue square represents the shape of the exposed copper pad. The green squares are the required openings in the stencil.

Custom stencil openings are accommodated as follows:

  .. Construct copper shape with pad(s) with only copper layers (`F.Cu` and/or `B.Cu`) as appropriate
  .. Add stencil opening(s) with pad(s) which only use solderpaste layers (`F.Paste` and/or `B.Paste`) as required. These pads _do not have a pad number_.
