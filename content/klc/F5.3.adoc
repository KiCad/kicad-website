brief = "Courtyard layer requirements"
+++

The component courtyard is defined as the smallest rectangular area that provides a
minimum electrical and mechanical clearance around the combined component body and land
pattern boundaries.
It is allowed to create a contoured courtyard area using a polygon instead of a simple rectangle. (IPC-7351C)

The courtyard should include any extra required clearance for mating connectors (for example).

KiCad refers to the courtyard layers as:

* `F.CrtYd` - Front courtyard layer
* `B.CrtYd` - Back courtyard layer

A fully enclosed Component courtyard must be drawn on the `F.CrtYd` layer, with the following parameters:

. Courtyard uses `0.05mm` line width
. All courtyard line elements are placed on a `0.01mm` grid
. If the component requires a courtyard on the back of the PCB, a corresponding courtyard must be provided on the `B.CrtYd` layer.

Courtyard clearance should adhere to the following requirements:

[start=4]
. Unless otherwise specified, clearance is `0.25mm`
. Components smaller than `0603` should have a clearance of `0.15mm`
. Connectors should have a clearance of `0.5mm`, in addition to the clearance required for mating of connector
. Canned capacitors should have a clearance of `0.5mm`
. Crystals should have a clearance of `0.5mm`
. BGA devices should have a clearance of `1.0mm`
