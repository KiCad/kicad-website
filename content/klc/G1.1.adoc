brief = "Only standard characters are used for naming libraries and components"

Filenames, symbol names, footprint names and model names must contain only valid characters, as determined below:

1. Alphanumeric characters (`A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`)
1. Underscore `_`
1. Hyphen / dash `-`
1. Period / dot `.`

This character set ensures that symbols will be compatible with all filesytems, and will not cause any issues due to character rendering.

Further, filenames and symbol names should **not use the space character**. This can cause issues with string escaping and is best avoided.
