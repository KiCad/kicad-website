brief = "Only standard characters are used for naming libraries and components"

Filenames, symbol names, footprint names, model names, 3D model names, and template names must contain only valid characters, as determined below:

. Alphanumeric characters (`A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`)
. Underscore `_`
. Hyphen / dash `-`
. Period / dot `.`
. Comma `,`
. Plus symbol `+`

This character set ensures that symbols will be compatible with all filesystems, and will not cause any issues due to character rendering.

Further, filenames and symbol names must **not use the space character**. This can cause issues with string escaping and is best avoided.
