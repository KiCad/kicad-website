brief = "Active low pins should be designated using a bar above the symbol name"
+++

Rather than selecting the _active low_ graphical pin style, active low pins should be designated using a bar above the pin name.

This provides a cleaner look for the schematic.

To place a line above the pin text, prefix the name with the tilde (`~`) character.
