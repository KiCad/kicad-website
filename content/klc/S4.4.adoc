Pin `Electrical type` should be set to match the appropriate pin function

1. Power and ground pins should be set to either `Power Input` or `Power Outpu`
1. Logic pins should be set according to datasheet requirements
1. Pins with programmable functionality (e.g. MCU I/O ports) should be set to `Bidirectional`
1. Pins must not be 'double inverted' by assigning the inverting graphical symbol and also having a bar above the name of the pin
