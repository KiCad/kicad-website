+++

Through hole components should set the shape of Pin 1 to `Rectangular`, and all other pads to either `Circular` or `Oval`. This aids in orienting the component during placement and also for locating Pin 1 for circuit troubleshooting.

Pad shape can be adjusted in the *Pad Properties* dialog:

**Exception:**

Non polarized parts (such as THT resistors) should not set the shape of Pin 1 to Rectangular. For these (non polarized) footprints, all pad shapes should be consistent.
