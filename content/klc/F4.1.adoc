brief = "Silkscreen layer requirements"
+++

The silkscreen is printed to the external surface of a PCB to aid in component identification and orientation.

KiCad refers to the silkscreen layers as:

* `F.SilkS` - Front silkscreen layer
* `B.SilkS` - Back silkscreen layer

1. Reference Designator should be drawn on `F.SilkS` layer
  1. Text size = `1.00mm`
  1. Text thickness = `0.15mm`
1. Silkscreen should not be placed over pads or areas of exposed copper
1. For SMD footprints, silkscreen must be fully visible after boards assembly (no silkscreen under component)
1. For THT components, silkscreen may be placed under component to aid in assembly process
1. Silkscreen line width is
1. Pin-1 designator
