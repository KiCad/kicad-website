brief = "Pad requirements for THT footprints"
+++

Through hole pads must have soldermask pulled back to allow soldering. However they must not have solderpaste openings as they do not receive solder paste during stencil screening.

1. Pads for THT footprints must have the following layers set:
.. All copper layers
.. `F.Mask` (front mask)
.. `B.Mask` (back mask)
1. Pads must **not** have the silkscreen layers active
