brief = "Symbols with complex functionality may incorporate simple functional diagrams"
+++

For _black box_ symbols with complex functionality (e.g. special function ICs), a simplified diagram of the symbol functionality may be draw on the symbol. This may be used to provide functional clarity in a schematic.

1. Functional drawing must remain _simple_
1. Do not add functional drawings for multi-function components (e.g. microcontrollers)
