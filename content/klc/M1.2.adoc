brief = "Manufacturer models should not be duplicated"
+++

If a manufacturer provides 3D model data for download from its website, these models should not be duplicated in the KiCad library.

A link to the manufacturer model files may be added to the `README.md` file within the 3D model directory.

**Exception:**

If 3D model data provided by a manufacturer is of low quality or not available for public download, then these data may be added if the following criteria are met:

* The contributor is the creator of the model data
* The contributed files provide some advantage over the data supplied by the manufacturer
