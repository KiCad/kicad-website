brief = "Keepout Areas"
+++

KiCad does not yet have a method for drawing keepout areas inside footprint files. Until this feature is implemented, footprint keepout areas should be indicated using the following procedure:

1. Keepout area shape should be drawn on the `Dwgs.User` layer
1. Area should be hatched diagonally
1. Descriptive text may be included on the `Cmts.User` layer. This text is used to provide further information about keepout requirements to the user.

Example:

{{< klcimg src="F3.5" >}}
