brief = "Non-functional variations in part number should be replaced with wildcard"
+++

Manufacturer Part Numbers (MPN) often include variations that are _non-functional_.

Examples:

* Temperature rating of the component
* Packaging information (e.g. reel, tray, tape)
* RoHS / PbFree information

To capture every possible combination of part variation would require a large number of symbol aliases - this is to be avoided.

Where a MPN has options for such non-functional variations, these portions of the MPN should be replaced with a wildcard character (`x`).

**Rule of thumb**

A single symbol should be drawn for each footprint variation of a fully specified symbol (or atomic part). Other variations (as listed above) do not require their own symbol but should be added as an alias.
