1. Using a `100mil` (`2.54mm`) grid, pin origin must lie on grid node (IEC-60617)
1. Pins should have a length of at least `100mil` (`2.54mm`)
* Shorter pins may be allowed to accommodate simple symbols for discrete devices such as resistors, capacitors, etc
1. Pin length must not exceed `300mil` (`7.62mm`)
1. Pin length can be increment in steps of `50mil` (`1.27mm`) as required, whilst meeting the absolute length limits as specified above
