. Using a `100mil` (`2.54mm`) grid, pin origin must lie on a grid node (IEC-60617)
. Pins should have a length of at least `100mil` (`2.54mm`)
* Pin length can be increased in steps of `50mil` (`1.27mm`)
* The number of characters in the pin number determine a pin's length. When there are two characters in the pin number then 100mil (`2.54mm`) long pins should be used, when three characters then 150mil (`3.81mm`) long pins should be used, etc.
* Pin length must not exceed 300mil (7.62mm)
* Shorter pins are allowed on simple symbols for discrete devices such as resistors, capacitors, etc.
* All pins on a symbol must have the same length
. Pin numbers must be unique (no two pins may have the same number)
