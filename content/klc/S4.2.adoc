brief = "Pins should be grouped by function"
+++

Pins should be grouped by similar function, rather than by their physical location on the associated footprint.

1. Pins with *similar functions* should be grouped together:
  * `SPI_MISO`, `SPI_MOSI`, `SPI_CS` `SPI_CS`
  * `UART_TX`, `UART_RX`
1. *Ports* should be ordered from top to bottom
1. *Positive power* pins should be placed at the _top_ of a symbol
  * `Vcc`, `Vdd`, `Vin`, `V+`, etc
1. *Negative power* and *ground* pins should be placed at the _bottom_ of a symbol
  * `GND`, `Vss`, `V-`, etc
1. *Input/Control/Logic* pins shold be placed on the _left_ of a symbol
  * `UART Tx/Rx`
1. *Output/Controlled/Driver* pins should be placed on the _right_ of a symbol
  * `RS232 Tx/Rx`
