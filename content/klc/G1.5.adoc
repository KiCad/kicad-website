brief = "Plural naming should be avoided"
+++

In general, plural naming (e.g. for libraries) should be avoided, as pluralisation of some words is inconsistent. Non pluralized names should be used in preference:

* `sensor_temperature` instead of `sensors_temperature`
* `memory_flash` instead of `memories_flash`
