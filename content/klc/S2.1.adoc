brief = "General symbol naming guidelines"
+++

. Library naming should not be duplicated in symbol name
. Symbol representing one specific component
.. The manufacturer part number is used as the symbol name (More detail see link:/libraries/klc/S2.2/[KLC 2.2])
.. If a symbol with the same name exists for multiple manufacturers, the manufacturer name is written first
. Symbol representing a compatible part produced by multiple manufacturers:
.. Symbol name is the base part number. (The element of the part number shared by all manufacturers.)
.. A suffix indicating the connected footprint is added
.. Examples: `L78L05_SO8`, `LM358_DFN8`
. Name for generic symbols
.. May be shortened for common components (e.g. `Conn` for `Connector`)
.. Reference designator may be substituted for common components (e.g. `D`, `C`, `LED`)
.. Any modification of the original symbol, indicated by appending the reason (e.g. different pin ordering - `Q_NPN_CBE`, `Q_NPN_BCE`)
.. Indicate quantity of elements for symbol arrays (e.g. resistor array with 8 elements - `Resistor_x8`)
