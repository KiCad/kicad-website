brief = "General symbol naming guidelines"
+++

. Library name should not be duplicated in symbol name
. If symbol with same name exists for multiple manufacturers, the manufacturer name is written first
. Specific manufacturer name (for atomic parts)
. Type of symbol (for generic parts)
.. May be shortened for common components (e.g. `Conn` for `Connector`)
.. Reference designator may be substituted for common components (e.g. `D`, `C`, `LED`)
. Part name should include extension for specific footprint if the same part is produced by multiple manufacturers that have conflicting package name suffixes (e.g. `SOIC`)
.. The pin number may be appended if there are multiple package possibilities (e.g. `SOIC8`)
. Any modification of the original symbol, indicated by appending the reason (e.g. different pin ordering - `Q_NPN_CBE`, `Q_NPN_BCE`)
. Indicate quantity of elements for symbol arrays (e.g. resistor array with 8 elements - `Resistor_x8`)
. Add suffixes for symbol variations
.. For multi-unit variants of typically single-unit symbols add the suffix `_Split`
