brief = "General symbol naming guidelines"
+++

. Library naming should not be duplicated in footprint name
. If symbol with same name exists for multiple manufacturers, the manufacturer name is written first
. Specific manufacturer name (for fully specified symbols)
. Type of symbol (for generic symbols)
.. May be shortened for common components (e.g. `Conn` for `Connector`)
.. Reference designator may be substituted for common components (e.g. `D`, `C`, `LED`)
. Part name should include extension for specific footprint if required (e.g. `SOIC`)
. Any modification of the original symbol, indicated by appending the reason (e.g. different pin ordering - `Q_NPN_CBE`, `Q_NPN_BCE`)
. Indicate quantity of elements for symbol arrays (e.g. resistor array with 8 elements - `Resistor_x8`)
. Add suffixes for symbol variations
.. For multi unit variants of typically single unit symbols add the suffix `_Split`
