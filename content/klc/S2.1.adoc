brief = "General symbol naming guidelines"
+++

. Library naming should not be duplicated in symbol name
. Symbol representing one specific component
.. The manufacturer part number is used as the symbol name (More detail see link:/libraries/klc/S2.2/[KLC 2.2])
.. If a symbol with the same name exists (in the same library) for multiple manufacturers, the manufacturer name is included as a prefix to avoid collisions.
. Symbol representing a series of parts
.. The part of the manufacturer part number that identifies the series is used as the symbol name.
.. Parts of the MPN that are not necessary do identify the series are replaced with a wildcard char ('X'). If the unnecessary chars are on the end of the MPN is it allowed to cut them off instead of replacing them with a wildcard char.
.. Example: `BLE03XXXXXXX1X`
. Symbol representing a compatible part produced by multiple manufacturers:
.. Symbol name is the base part number. (The element of the part number shared by all manufacturers.)
.. A suffix indicating the connected footprint is added
.. Examples: `L78L05_SO8`, `LM358_DFN8`
. Name for generic symbols
.. May be shortened for common components (e.g. `Conn` for `Connector`)
.. Reference designator may be substituted for common components (e.g. `D`, `C`, `LED`)
.. Any modification of the original symbol, indicated by appending the reason (e.g. different pin ordering - `Q_NPN_CBE`, `Q_NPN_BCE`)
.. Indicate quantity of elements for symbol arrays (e.g. resistor array with 8 elements - `Resistor_x8`)
