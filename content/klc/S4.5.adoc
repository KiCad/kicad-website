brief = "Pins not connected on the footprint may be omitted from the symbol"
+++

Often a component has pins that are not physically connected, and in such cases, unconnected pins may be omitted from the schematic symbol.

1. Pins may only be ommitted if they are never to be connected _under any circumstances_
1. If pins are designated `NC` but the datasheet specifies that these must be pulled to ground or otherwise connected to a specific net, then these **must** be shown on the schematic symbol
1. If the pin-count in the schematic does not match the pad-count on the footprint, the footprint filter must include the pad-count of the footprint
* `SOT?23?5`
* `SOIC?8`
