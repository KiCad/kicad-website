brief = "Pins not connected on the footprint may be omitted from the symbol"
+++

Often a component has pins that are not physically connected, and may be omitted from the schematic symbol.

1. If the pin-count in the schematic does not match the pad-count on the footprint, the footprint filter should include the pad-count of the footprint
..* `SOIC?8`
..* `SOT?23?5`
1. If pins are designated `NC` but the datasheet specifies that these must be pulled to ground or otherwise connected to a specific net, then these **must** be shown on the schematic symbol
