brief = "Manufacturer specific footprints"
+++

If a manufacturer footprint deviates from the "standard" footprints available, then this should be added to the library and designated as manufacturer-specific.

1. If a footprint is specific to a single manufacturer, this must be indicated by prepending the manufacturer name and MPN to the footprint name.

1. Sometimes the component datasheet will have specific requirements which do not comform to KLC requirements. A common example is specific requirements for the shape of stencil (solder paste layer).

In such cases, the KLC requirements can be superceded by the datasheet requirements, at the discretion of the KiCad library team.
