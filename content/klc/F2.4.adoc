Generally, a footprint should include a field of the format `<pkg>-<pincount>`, e.g.

* `SOIC-8`
* `QFN-24`

In the majority of cases, the pin quantity is self explanatory and is sufficient to describe the number of pins on the symbol.

1. Sometimes the component datasheet will have specific requirements which do not conform to KLC requirements. A common example is specific requirements for the shape of stencil (solder paste layer).

In such cases, the KLC requirements can be superseded by the datasheet requirements, at the discretion of the KiCad library team.
