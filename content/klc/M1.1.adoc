brief = "Permitted 3D model file types"
+++

The KiCad 3D model library supports two file formats:

=== WRL

* WRL files contain material properties and are used for realistic rendering. However they cannot be exported to MCAD packages.
* KiCad v4.x and lower can only render WRL files

=== STEP

* STEP files are use for integration with MCAD software packages. These files do not contain material properties and cannot be used for realistic rendering.
* KiCad v5.x and above can render STEP files directly in the 3D viewer

Only models provided in these file formats will be accepted.

It is suggested that a .WRL and .STEP version of the model are provided simultaneously. This provides options for both high quality rendering and MCAD integration.
