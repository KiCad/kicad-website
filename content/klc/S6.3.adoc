brief = "Component metadata is added to symbol (and all aliases)"
+++

Component metadata is contained in the `<libname>.dcm` file, and must be filled in for each unique symbol (and each alias for the symbol).

1. **Description** field contains comma-separated device information
.. For symbols with a default footprint, the simplified footprint name should be appended to the description e.g. `SOIC-8`
.. Part name should not be duplicated in the description field
1. **Keywords** field contains space-separated keyword values. These values are used to assist in part searching and should not include filler words
1. **Documentation File Name** field contains URL to part documentation if applicable, or is otherwise left blank
