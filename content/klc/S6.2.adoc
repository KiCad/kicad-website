. *Reference* field is selected appropriately for the symbol and is _visible_
. *Value* field contains the name of the symbol and is _visible_
. *Footprint* field contains footprint link for fully specified symbols and must be _invisible_
.. The footprint field must be empty for generic symbols
. *Datasheet* entry [1] is filled out, and is _invisible_
. The symbol contains no other custom fields

Additional documentation is provided via two other fields:
[start=6]
. **Description** field contains comma-separated device information
.. For symbols with a default footprint, the simplified footprint name should be appended to the description e.g. `SOIC-8`
.. Part name should not be duplicated in the description field
. **Keywords** field contains space-separated keyword values. These values are used to assist in part searching and should not include filler words

**Aliases** define their own values for the datasheet link, description and keyword entries.

{{< klcimg src="alias_metadata" title="Alias metadata example" >}}

_[1]: KiCad 5.x and earlier have two places to store the datasheet link. It can be in the `.lib` file once per symbol or in the `.dcm` file allowing different datasheets per alias. Having different datasheets for aliases only works if the `.lib` entry is left empty. This is the default in version 5.1.x._
