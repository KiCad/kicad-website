brief = "Libraries should be organized by functionality"
+++

Rather than grouping components (e.g. symbols, footprints) by their manufacturer, KiCad libraries are organized by component functionality. This grouping strategy has a number of key benefits:

* Similar components are grouped together, allowing alternative parts to be easily substituted
* Symbol _aliases_ for pin-identical symbols can be used to reduce library size
* Generic parts which are produced by multiple manufacturers are supported

Library organization should follow the general form as described below, with each element separated by the underscore (`_`) character:

1. Library function
1. Library sub-function
1. Tertiary qualifier
1. Manufacturer name
1. Component series name
1. Extra library descriptors

_Note: Some of the elements listed above may be omitted if not required._

For specific examples, refer to the guidelines for organizing link:/klc/S1.1[symbol libraries] and link:/klc/F1.1[footprint libraries].
