Hidden connection pins are generally not allowed for schematic symbols. Any connection point must be visible, otherwise unexpected net connections can occur.

Hidden power pins are also not allowed.

**Exceptions**

1. Unused NC pins can be set to invisible. In this case the electrical type must be `Not Connected`
1. Invisible pins may be used in a pin stack to allow one-to-many connections. Refer to the requirements on pin stacking
