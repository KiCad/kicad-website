Hidden connection pins are generally not allowed for schematic symbols. Any connection point must be visible, otherwise unexpected net connections can occur.

Hidden power pins are also not allowed.

**Exceptions**

. Unused NC pins can be set to invisible. In this case the electrical type must be `Not Connected`. The end of the pin should lie on the symbols outline box to prevent unwanted connections to the invisible pin (see screenshot below).
. Invisible pins may be used in a pin stack to allow one-to-many connections. Refer to the link:/klc/S4.3[requirements for pin stacking]
