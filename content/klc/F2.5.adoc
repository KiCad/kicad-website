brief = "Naming conventions for individual footprint types"
+++

Footprint naming is sufficiently complex that a link:/klc/F2.1/[general rule] is not enough to fully define the wide range of footprints.

Following is a list of naming conventions for various groups of footprint types. If you do not find a matching convention in the list below, contact the KiCad library team or find an existing set of components in the libraries that closely match your requirements.

{{< fp_naming_common >}}

For each of the items listed below, if the footprint is specific to a single manufacturer, then the footprint name should be prefixed as follows:

`[MAN]\_[MPN]_` (More detailse see link:/klc/F2.4/[F2.4 Manufacturer Specific Footprints])

=== Standard IC packages

```
[PKG]-[PIN]{-[EP qty]EP}_[X]xY{x[Z]}_P[pitch]{_Lead[Lead details]}{_EP[X]x[Y]{_Mask[X]x[Y]}}{_PAD[pad modifiers]}{_[footprint options]}
```
