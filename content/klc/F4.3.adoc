brief = "Connected copper elements have the same pad number"
+++

Footprints that contain multiple pads or conductive elements that are *physically connected* require special attention:

. Multiple pads that are physically connected must share the same number
. Thermal vias (if present) must share the same number as the thermal pad to which they are connected
. Overlapping pads should be replaced with custom shapes
. Pads and shapes should not be rotated arbitrarily. Ex: If you can swap width and height to avoid a 90deg rotation you should do so.
