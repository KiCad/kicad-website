brief = "Courtyard layer requirements"
+++

The component courtyard provides physical component boundaries to ensure that components do not interfere when placed on the board. The courtyard should also include any extra required clearance for mating connectors (for example).

KiCad refers to the courtyard layers as:

* `F.CrtYd` - Front courtyard layer
* `B.CrtYd` - Back courtyard layer

Component courtyard should be drawn on the `F.CrtYd` layer as a closed polyline, with the following parameters:

1. Courtyard uses `0.05mm` line width
1. All courtyard line elements are placed on a `0.01mm` grid

If the component requires a courtyard on the back of the PCB, a corresponding courtyard must be provided on the `B.CrtYd` layer.

Courtyard clearance should adhere to the following requirements:

[start=3]
1. Unless otherwise specified, clearance is `0.25mm`
1. Components smaller than `0603` should have a clearance of `0.15mm`
1. Connectors should have a clearance of `0.5mm`, in addition to the clearance required for mating of connector
1. Canned capacitors should have a clearance of `0.5mm`
1. Crystals should have a clearance of `0.5mm`
1. BGA devices should have a clearance of `1.0mm`
