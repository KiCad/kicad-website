brief = "Source files for 3D models should be supplied"
+++

The KiCad library maintains a repository for 3D source files at link:https://github.com/kicad/kicad-packages3d-source[https://github.com/kicad/kicad-packages3d-source].

The _source files_ used to generate 3D model data should be submitted to this repository when a user contributes 3D model data.

Source files include file generator scripts, or native model files from source software (e.g. FreeCAD).

The source repository directory structure mirrors that of the kicad-packages-3d repository.
