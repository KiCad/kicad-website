+++

The 3D models must be aligned and scaled appropriately to match the associated footprint.

=== Alignment

The 3D model must be aligned such that it does not require an additional alignment offset in the footprint options. When associating a 3D model with a footprint, the `offset` parameter must read (`0`, `0`, `0`)

=== Scaling

1. STEP files include absolute dimensional information, and _should never have a secondary scaling factor applied_. The model `scaling` parameter in KiCad must read (`1`, `1`, `1`)
1. WRL files do not specify absolute dimensions. KiCad normalizes model parameters to units of _inches_ and the internal units (dimensionless) of the WRL model must be scaled accordingly.

=== Rotation

The model should be rotated such that no additional rotation is required within KiCad.
