brief = "Symbol origin is centered on the middle of the symbol"
+++

The symbol must be centered around the origin (`0`, `0`) in the symbol editor.

*Exception:*

For non-symmetrical symbols, or symbols where this requirement would move pins off the `100mil` grid, then the symbol shold be placed _as close to the origin as possible_ while observing the pin grid alignment requirements.
