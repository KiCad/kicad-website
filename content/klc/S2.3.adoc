brief = "Where atomic parts are available in multiple footprint options, a separate symbol must be drawn for each footprint"
+++

Many electronic components are provided in multiple footprint (package) options. These _may or may not_ be pin compatible.

e.g. **LTC4357**

{{< klcimg src="S2.4a" title="Multiple footprint options" >}}

Here there is a requirement for two separate symbols, one corresponding to each available footprint.

The naming of the symbols must match the manufacturer naming convention for the footprint variants. In the image above (taken from the datasheet) the footprints are defined as follows:

* `DCB` - 6-lead DFN
* `MS8` - 8-lead MSOP

Thus, two symbols must be drawn:

{{< klcimg src="S2.4b" title="Symbol for each footprint" >}}

Where possible, the symbols should be drawn such that they can be swapped in the schematic with minimal disruption to wire connections.

As a further example we shall consider the comparator **MCP6566** which is available in three SOT-23-3 versions, _each with a different pinout_.

In this case, a separate symbol must again be drawn for each version, and named according to the convention called out in the datasheet.
