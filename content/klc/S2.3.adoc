brief = "Where parts are available in multiple footprint options, a separate symbol must be drawn for each footprint"
+++

Many electronic components are provided in multiple packaging variants. These _may or may not_ be pin compatible.

KiCad is not able to assign different footprints for aliases. Fully specified symbols therefore require a separate symbol for every package variant. Similarly kicad is not able to define different 3d models other than having a separate footprint. This means a part needs a separate footprint even if the land pattern is the same if the 3d model has functional differences (example different height).

e.g. **LTC4357**

{{< klcimg src="S2.4a" title="Multiple footprint options" >}}

This part comes in two distinct packages each requiring a separate footprint. Hence a symbol for each variant must be drawn.

For naming of the symbols refer to link:/libraries/klc/S2.1[General symbol naming guidelines]

{{< klcimg src="S2.4b" title="Symbol for each footprint" >}}

Where possible, the symbols should be drawn such that they can be swapped in the schematic with minimal disruption to wire connections.

As a further example we shall consider the comparator **MCP6566** which is available in three SOT-23-5 versions, _each with a different pinout_.

In this case, a separate symbol must again be drawn for each version, and named according to the convention called out in the datasheet.
