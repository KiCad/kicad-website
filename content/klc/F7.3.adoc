brief = "Pin 1 should be rectangular or a rounded rectangle. Other pads circular or oval"
+++

Through hole components should set the shape of Pin 1 to `Rectangular` or `Rounded Rectangle`, and all other pads to either `Circular` or `Oval`.
This aids in orienting the component during placement and also for locating Pin 1 for circuit troubleshooting.
For rounded rectangle pads the corner size should be 25% with a maximum radius of 0.25mm.

Pad shape can be adjusted in the *Pad Properties* dialog:

**Exception:**

Non polarized parts (such as THT resistors) should not set the shape of Pin 1 to Rectangular. For these (non polarized) footprints, all pad shapes should be consistent.
