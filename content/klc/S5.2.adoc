brief = "Footprint filters should match all appropriate footprints"
+++

Footprint filters are used to help match appropriate footprints to a given symbol. This is important even for _atomic_ symbols (symbols with only one matching footprint), as there still may be multiple compatible footprints with different variants or options (e.g. `_HandSoldering`, `_Heatsink`, `_ThermalPads`).

Footprint filters use wildcard pattern matching, and allow the following wildcards:

* `*` - Match zero or many characters
* `?` - Match zero or one characters
* `:` - Include the library name in the search (can only be used once)

Filter conventions:

1. Filters should end with a `*` wildcard to allow matching of modified footprint suffixes
1. Filters should match the dimensional information (where required) to be as specific as necessary:
* `DIP*W7.62mm*` to match `DIP-22_W7.62mm` but not `DIP-22_W9.3mm`
1. By default, the footprint search does _not_ include the name of the footprint library in the. To force the library name to be included, add the `:` (colon) character to the filter. Text appearing before the `:` will match the library name. Text appearing after the `:` will match the footprint name.
* `Conn*:*Pitch?1.25mm*` will match any footprint with '1.25mm' pitch, only in libraries that begin with the text 'Conn'

Footprint filters can be set in the *Footprint Filter* tab in the *Symbol Properties* window.
