brief = "Generic, fully specified and atomic parts."

KiCad is flexible with how a footprint for a symbol can be selected. In general there are at least two workflows:

. Generic symbol: The user assigns the footprint after (or during) symbol placement in Eeschema.
  - Footprint filters may be used to reduce the set of possible footprints.
  - Generic descriptive name
. Fully specified symbol: Footprint pre designed as part of the symbol.
  - Footprint field is set for the footprint fitting the component.
  - Footprint filters allow selection of slight variations of this footprint.
  - Named via the manufacturer part number

Details about footprint filters and default footprints can be found in link:/libraries/klc/#anchor-S5.x[KLC S5.x].
Symbol naming guidelines are detailed in link:/libraries/klc/#anchor-S2.x[KLC S2.x].

**Generic symbols**

Generic symbols can be used with multiple footprints, and _do not_ have a default footprint assigned. Generic symbols allow flexibility in the design workflow. Symbols are first added to the schematic, and the footprint is selected before PCB layout. Using generic symbols allows a small number of library symbol elements to represent a _very large number_ of possible component combinations.

Generic symbols are limited to the following libraries:

* Device
* Connector and all Connector_Generic derivatives
* Switch
* Libraries holding the generic IC families (74xx and 40xx).


An example of a generic symbol is the capacitor symbol.

* Symbol name is `C`
* Footprint filter set to `C_*` which does match non polarized capacitor footprints in all libraries.

Another example is the symbol for one of the logic chips.

* Base Part Number is used as the symbol name
* Multiple footprint filters allow one symbol to be used for all possible packaging variants

**Fully specified symbols vs. atomic parts**

Fully specified symbols are ready to be placed onto the PCB as they are already associated with a footprint.
This removes one opportunity for errors. BOM creation is also made easier as such symbols typically represent one part.

An atomic part has a footprint specific to this one component (The footprint is meant for only one symbol. There is a 1:1 relation.) Yes this means a symbol for an atomic part is fully specified. (But a fully specified symbol is not necessarily atomic.)

The manufacturer part number is used for the symbol name for both of these.

An example for a fully specified symbol. Note that it points to a generic TO-252 footprint.

An example for an atomic part. Note that both the footprint and symbol include the part number.

**Exceptions**

The above categories represent the extreme ends of possible workflows.
It makes sense to allow for some middle ground.

**_Exception for compatible parts produced by multiple manufacturers_**

Only one symbol is needed to represent compatible parts produced by many manufacturers.
In such cases the base part number is used to identify the symbol and the package name is added as a suffix

{{< klcimg src="G2.1_example_exception_man" title="Exception symbol for multiple manufacturers" >}}


**_Exception for a series of parts_**

For parts like inductors or ferrite beads it does not really make sense to have one fully specified symbol for every possible value. Including a symbol with an already assigned footprint representing a series of them is still useful.
For such a symbol the parts of the MPN that represent the value of it are replaced by a wildcard character ('X').

**Preference in the official library**

* Fully specified symbols representing one part are the preferred method.
** If the part falls under one of the exceptions listed above, that method should be used instead.
* Atomic parts rarely make sense for the official library. Using them is allowed for a component that requires a highly specialized footprint. (Examples are some relays and RF_Modules)
* Generic symbols should only be used where it does not make sense to have a specialized symbol for every possible variation.
