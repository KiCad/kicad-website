brief = "Generic, fully specified and atomic parts."

KiCad is flexible with how symbols and footprints can be connected. In general there are at least two workflows:
. Generic symbol: Assign the footprint after (or during) symbol placement in eeschema.
.. Footprint filters may be used to reduce the set of possible footprints.
. Fully specified symbol: Assign a default footprint in the symbol.
.. Footprint field is set for one footprint
.. Footprint filters allow selection of slight variations of this footprint

The later workflow can be split up further
. Symbol represents a family of parts produced by many manufacturers
.. Symbol name is the base part number plus a suffix for communicating the connected footprint
. Symbol represents one part but does use a generic footprint
.. Symbol name is the full manufacturer part number
. Both symbol and footprint are specific to one part (= atomic part)
.. Both symbol and footprint name contain the manufacturer part number

Details about symbol naming can be found in link:/libraries/klc/#s2/[KLC 2.x]

**Generic symbols**

Generic symbols can be used with multiple footprints, and _do not_ have a default footprint assigned. Generic symbols allow flexibility in the design workflow. Symbols are first added to the schematic, and the footprint is selected before PCB layout. Using generic symbols allows a small number of library symbol elements to represent a _very large number_ of possible component combinations.

Generic symbols are limited to the following libraries:
. Device
. Connector and all Connector_Generic derivatives
. Switch
. And to some extend the Logic libs.

An example of the use of generic symbols are the **Resistor** and **Capacitor** symbols available in the KiCad library. These symbols do not have an assigned default footprint, as there are _many_ possible compatible footprints.

**Fully specified symbols or atomic parts**

These fully define a component, specifying a matching footprint, and are named based on the `MPN` (manufacturer part number). They are ready to be placed onto the PCB as they are already associated with a footprint.

**Preference in the library**

The preferred option are fully specified symbols with symbol name equal to the manufacturer part number and a generic footprint assigned to it.
Where a part is produced in a compatible form by many manufactuers it is allowed to create a more generic variation with the footprint indicated via a suffix.
Atomic parts rarely make sense for the official library. It is allowed to be used where a component has a footprint that is highly specialized to this component. (Example are some relays)
Generic symbols should only be used where it does not make sense to have a specialized symbol for every possible variation.
