brief = "Generic, fully specified and atomic parts."

KiCad is flexible with how symbols and footprints can be connected. In general there are at least two workflows:

. Generic symbol: Assign the footprint after (or during) symbol placement in eeschema.
  - Footprint filters may be used to reduce the set of possible footprints.
. Fully specified symbol: Default footprint setup in library.
  - Footprint field is set for one footprint.
  - Footprint filters allow selection of slight variations of this footprint.

Details about footprint filters and default footprints can be found in link:/libraries/klc/#anchor-S5.x[KLC S5.x]

**Generic symbols**

Generic symbols can be used with multiple footprints, and _do not_ have a default footprint assigned. Generic symbols allow flexibility in the design workflow. Symbols are first added to the schematic, and the footprint is selected before PCB layout. Using generic symbols allows a small number of library symbol elements to represent a _very large number_ of possible component combinations.

Generic symbols are limited to the following libraries:
. Device
. Connector and all Connector_Generic derivatives
. Switch
. And to some extend the Logic libs.

An example of a generic symbol is the capacitor symbol.

* Symbol name is `C`
* Footprint filter set to `C_*` which does match non polarized capacitor footprints in all libs.

The generic connector symbol is another example.

* Symbol name is `Conn_01x05`
* Footprint filter set to `Connector*:*_1x??_*` which does match single row footprints (`\*\_1x??_*`) in Connector libs.

**Fully specified symbols or atomic parts**

Fully specified symbols are ready to be placed onto the PCB as they are already associated with a footprint.

This workflow can be further split up into:

. Symbol represents a family of parts produced by many manufacturers
  - Symbol name is the base part number plus a suffix for communicating the connected footprint
. Symbol represents one part but does use a generic footprint
  - Symbol name is the manufacturer part number
. Both symbol and footprint are specific to one part (= atomic part)
  - Both symbol and footprint name contain the manufacturer part number

Details about symbol naming can be found in link:/libraries/klc/#anchor-S2.x[KLC S2.x]

An example of a fully specified symbol.

{{< klcimg src="G2.1_example_fully_specified" title="Fully specified" >}}

An example of a fully specified symbol compatible with parts produced by many manufacturers.

An example of an atomic part.

**Preference in the official library**

* Fully specified symbols representing one part are the preferred method.
* Where a part is produced in a compatible form by many manufactures, it is allowed to create a more generic variation with the footprint indicated via a suffix.
* Atomic parts rarely make sense for the official library. It is allowed to be used where a component has a footprint that is highly specialized to this component. (Example are some relays and RF_Modules)
* Generic symbols should only be used where it does not make sense to have a specialized symbol for every possible variation.
