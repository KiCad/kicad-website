brief = "Generic, fully specified and atomic parts."

KiCad is flexible with how symbols and footprints can be connected. In general there are at least two workflows:

. Generic symbol: Assign the footprint after (or during) symbol placement in eeschema.
  - Footprint filters may be used to reduce the set of possible footprints.
  - Generic descriptive symbol name
. Fully specified symbol: Default footprint set in library.
  - Footprint field is set for the footprint fitting the component.
  - Footprint filters allow selection of slight variations of this footprint.
  - Named via the manufacturer part number

Details about footprint filters and default footprints can be found in link:/libraries/klc/#anchor-S5.x[KLC S5.x].
Symbol naming guidelines are detailed in link:/libraries/klc/#anchor-S2.x[KLC S2.x].

**Generic symbols**

Generic symbols can be used with multiple footprints, and _do not_ have a default footprint assigned. Generic symbols allow flexibility in the design workflow. Symbols are first added to the schematic, and the footprint is selected before PCB layout. Using generic symbols allows a small number of library symbol elements to represent a _very large number_ of possible component combinations.

Generic symbols are limited to the following libraries:

* Device
* Connector and all Connector_Generic derivatives
* Switch
* And to some extend the libs holding the generic IC families (74xx and 40xx).


An example of a generic symbol is the capacitor symbol.

* Symbol name is `C`
* Footprint filter set to `C_*` which does match non polarized capacitor footprints in all libs.

**Fully specified symbols or atomic parts**

Fully specified symbols are ready to be placed onto the PCB as they are already associated with a footprint.
This does remove one point where errors could be introduced. BOM creation is also made easier as such symbols typically represent one part.

---

A fully specified symbol typically represents a single component produced by one manufacturer. The manufacturer part number is used for the symbol name. A generic footprint is used as the default footprint.

---

Only one symbol is needed to represent compatible parts produced by many manufacturers.
In such cases the base part number is used to identify the symbol.
A suffix is added to communicate the footprint.

---

If both the symbol and footprint are unique to one component then this pair is called `atomic part`.
In this case both the symbol and footprint contain the manufacturer part number.

**Preference in the official library**

* Fully specified symbols representing one part are the preferred method.
* Where a part is produced in a compatible form by many manufactures, it is allowed to create a more generic variation with the footprint indicated via a suffix.
* Atomic parts rarely make sense for the official library. It is allowed to be used where a component has a footprint that is highly specialized to this component. (Example are some relays and RF_Modules)
* Generic symbols should only be used where it does not make sense to have a specialized symbol for every possible variation.
