brief = "Defining generic and fully specified symbols"
+++

KiCad generally has two work-flows with regards to assign a footprint to a symbol. It can be done in the library or using the "assign footprints tool" at the end of the design process.

**Generic symbols**

Generic symbols can be used with multiple footprints, and _do not_ have a default footprint assigned. Generic symbols allow flexibility in the design work-flow. Symbols are first added to the schematic, and the footprint is selected before PCB layout. Using generic symbols allows a small number of library symbol elements to represent a _very large number_ of possible component combinations.

An example of the use of generic symbols is the **Resistor** and **Capacitor** symbols available in the KiCad library. But also the logic family symbols which are pin compatible to a huge number of packages. These symbols do not have an assigned default footprint, as there are _many_ possible compatible footprints.

**Fully specified symbols**

Fully specified symbols define a matching footprint, and are named based on the `MPN` (manufacturer part number). Such symbols do not depend on the user to select the correct footprint later but can have alternative footprints defined using footprint filters such that the user can define it later.

Some users refer to fully specified symbols as atomic parts or a library of such components as atomic library. Atomic implies a one to one inseparable connection between assets. The closest that KiCad can get to is a fully specified symbol that points to a footprint specialized to the same component.

**Where to use which type**

The official library generally uses fully specified symbols where feasible. Generic symbols are limited to a small number of libraries that contain only generic symbols. These generic libraries are:

* `Device`
* All `Connector` libraries
* The logic family libraries like `74xx`, `4xxx`, ...
