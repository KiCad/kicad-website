brief = "Symbol libraries should be categorized by function"
+++

Symbol libraries are individual `.lib` files, which have a corresponding `.dcm` file. Both files are required to fully describe the symbols contained in the library.

Symbol library names should be defined based on the priority list below, with each element separated by the underscore (`_`) character:

1. Function (e.g. `sensor`, `amplifier` `MCU`)
1. Sub-function (e.g. `temperature`, `current-sense`)
1. Tertiary qualifier (e.g. `CMOS`)
1. Manufacturer name (e.g. `Atmel`, `Infineon`)
1. Symbol series name (e.g. `PIC24`, `STM32`)
1. Extra library descriptors (e.g. `deprecated` )

_Note: Some of the elements listed above may be omitted if not required._

Example symbol library names:

* `power_monitor` - Power monitoring components
* `sensor_temperature` - Temperature sensors
* `driver_motor` - Motor drivers
* `mcu_Microchip_PIC32` - PIC32 microcontrollers from Microchip
