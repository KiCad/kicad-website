brief = "Datasheet recommendations take priority"
+++

Where conflict exists between datasheet recommendations and KLC requirements, then (in the general case) the datasheet shold take priority.

It is important when designing footprints that they adhere to requirements for soldering and assembly - often these requirements have very small tolerance for variation.

If the KLC is at odds with the datasheet, follow the datasheet, and note this difference to the KiCad library team when submitting your contribution.
