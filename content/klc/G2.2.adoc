brief = "Non-functional variations in part number should be replaced with wildcard"
+++

Manufacturer Part Numbers (MPN) often include variations that are _non-functional_.

Examples:

* Temperature rating of the componen (e.g. I, A, E)
* Packaging information (e.g. reel, tray, tape)
* RoHs / PbFree information

Where a MPN has options for such non-functional variations, these portions of the MPN should be replaced with a wildcard character (`x`).

```
TODO:

- Add some examples where such variation is found
- Show examples of how to add wildcard character
```
