brief = "Footprint naming prefix abbreviations"
+++

A footprint name has to convey a lot of information to clearly specify the purpose and parameters of the footprint. Some fields in footprint names are _common_ to many footprints and can be abbreviated using special prefixes.

Not all footprints will require the use of these abbreviations - they are provided as a method of standardising the manner in which footprint parameters are called out when encountered.

For IC packages, the first dimension specified is always the size of the package body, in the following format:

`XxY{yZ}` where `Z` dimension is optional.

e.g. `SOIC-8_3.2x5.7_P1.27mm`

Refer to the table below for accepted prefix abbreviations.

{{< fp_prefix >}}

If the parameter is not found in the table above, the name of the parameter should be entered in full.

*Examples:*

* `LQFP-32_4x4x1.1_P1.65` - LQFP package, 32 pins, 4x4mm body, 1.1mm height, 1.65mm pitch
* `CP_Radial_D4.5_P2.5_H10` - Radial capacitor, 4.5mm diameter, 2.5mm pitch, 10mm height
