brief = "Footprint naming prefix abbreviations"
+++

A footprint name has to convey a lot of information to clearly specify the purpose and parameters of the footprint. Some fields in footprint names are _common_ to many footprints and can be shortened using special abbreviations.

Not all footprints will require the use of these abbreviations - they are provided as a method of standardising the manner in which footprint parameters are called out when encountered.

In many cases, the major dimensions (x/y/z) of a footprint may be specified without a prefix, as the body dimensions are assumed to have the greatest priority in the footprint name. In cases where potential conflicts exist, the body dimensions must be explicitly named with the prefix `B`.

e.g. `SOIC-8_3.2x5.7mm_P1.27mm`

Refer to the table below for accepted prefix abbreviations.

If the parameter is not found in the table above, the name of the parameter should be entered in full.

*Examples:*

* `LQFP-32_4x4x1.1mm_P1.65mm` - LQFP package, 32 pins, 4x4mm body, 1.1mm height, 1.65mm pitch
* `CP_Radial_D4.5mm_P2.5mm_H10mm` - Radial capacitor, 4.5mm diameter, 2.5mm pitch, 10mm height
