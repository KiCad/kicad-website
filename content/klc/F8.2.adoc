Footprint properties should be left as default, unless there is a reason to do so as specified by the footprint datasheet (for example).

1. *Move and Place* should be set to `Free`
1. *Auto Place* should be set to `0`, `0`
1. *Local Clearance Values* should all be set to `0`

{{< klcimg src="F7.2a" title="Default footprint properties" >}}

**Exceptions:**

The *Local Clearance Values* parameters are generally set to `0`, indicating that the global clearance values will be used to determine pad clearances.

If _all_ the pads on the particular footprint require a specific clearance value (for e.g. as described by the datasheet) then these values can be used here to override pad-specific settings for the entire footprint.
