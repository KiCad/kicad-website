The most recent source code for KiCad can be downloaded from the
https://code.launchpad.net/kicad[launchpad repository] or the
https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-source-mirror[github source mirror]
(updated every 10 minutes).

This source contains the most recent patches and is useful for
debugging and testing. If you build KiCad from source consider
joining the https://launchpad.net/~kicad-developers/[developer mailing
list] to post your improvements and
https://bugs.launchpad.net/kicad/[bug-fixes].

Other than the source code itself there are some other distibruted
elements that make up the full KiCad package, which is the KiCad
documentaiton (kicad-doc), the user interface translations
(kicad-i18n), and the schematic, footprint and 3D model libraries.

=== Stable Release

Current Version: *4.0.1*

Tarballs intended to be used by packagers:

* link:https://launchpad.net/kicad/4.0/4.0.1/+download/kicad-4.0.1.tar.xz[Source code]
* link:http://downloads.kicad-pcb.org/docs/kicad-doc-4.0.1.tar.gz[Precompiled docs], https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-doc/releases/tag/4.0.1[doc sources]

For the moment you are supposed to use the following options to set
the version string:

  -DKICAD_REPO_NAME=stable -DKICAD_BUILD_VERSION=4.0.1

And you encouraged to enable the python scripting, even though it is
not enabled by default with the following additional Cmake options.

  -DKICAD_SCRIPTING=ON -DKICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON -DKICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON

I has been deciced to do so such that packagers will

it on a case by case basis]. If you package for linux you are

to enable python scripting].
