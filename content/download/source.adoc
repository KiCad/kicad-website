The most recent source code for KiCad can be downloaded from the
https://code.launchpad.net/kicad[launchpad repository] or the
https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-source-mirror[github source mirror].

This source contains the most recent patches and is useful for
debugging and testing. If you build KiCad from source consider
joining the https://launchpad.net/~kicad-developers/[developer mailing
list] to post your improvements and
https://bugs.launchpad.net/kicad/[bug-fixes].

Other than the source code itself there are some other distibruted
elements that make up the full KiCad package, which is the KiCad
documentation (kicad-doc), the user interface translations
(kicad-i18n), and the schematic, footprint, 3D model libraries and
project templates.

== Stable Release

Current Version: *5.0.2*

Tarballs intended to be used by packagers:

With newer linux releases it might be easiest to disable the wxpython
option. This is becasue there is an incompatability between wxwidgets
which is not complied with gtk3 instead of gtk2, while wxpython does
not support gtk3 before it's phoenix release, which does not yet work
with KiCad. Help needed.

  -DKICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=OFF

It has been decided to do so such that packagers will

it on a case by case basis]. If you package for linux you are

to enable python scripting].

Due to API instability in the Boost.Context library, KiCad 5.0.2 ships with
a replacement implementation, which is partially written in assembler
language. Because of this, several platforms may fail to compile.

== Building KiCad

Instructions can be found in compiling.md which is located in the
kicad source code under `/Documentation/development` folder.

Alternatively, you can view it online here:
