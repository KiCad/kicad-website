The most recent source code for KiCad can be downloaded from the
https://code.launchpad.net/kicad[launchpad repository] or the
https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-source-mirror[github source mirror].

This source contains the most recent patches and is useful for
debugging and testing. If you build KiCad from source consider
joining the https://launchpad.net/~kicad-developers/[developer mailing
list] to post your improvements and
https://bugs.launchpad.net/kicad/[bug-fixes].

Other than the source code itself there are some other distibruted
elements that make up the full KiCad package, which is the KiCad
documentation (kicad-doc), the user interface translations
(kicad-i18n), and the schematic, footprint and 3D model libraries.

== Stable Release

Current Version: *4.0.7*

Tarballs intended to be used by packagers:

* link:https://launchpad.net/kicad/4.0/4.0.7/+download/kicad-4.0.7.tar.xz[Source code]
* link:http://downloads.kicad-pcb.org/docs/kicad-doc-4.0.7.tar.gz[Precompiled docs], https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-doc/releases/tag/4.0.7[doc sources]
* link:https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-i18n/releases/tag/4.0.7[Kicad-i18n]
* link:http://downloads.kicad-pcb.org/libraries/kicad-library-4.0.7.tar.gz[Kicad-library repo]
* link:http://downloads.kicad-pcb.org/libraries/kicad-footprints-4.0.7.tar.gz[Footprint repos]

You encouraged to enable the python scripting, even though it is
not enabled by default with the following additional Cmake options.

  -DKICAD_SCRIPTING=ON -DKICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON -DKICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON

It has been decided to do so such that packagers will
link:https://www.mail-archive.com/kicad-developers@lists.launchpad.net/msg15686.html[enable
it on a case by case basis]. If you package for linux you are
link:https://www.mail-archive.com/kicad-developers@lists.launchpad.net/msg15700.html[expected
to enable python scripting].

Before version 4.0.5 you were supposed to use the following options to set
the version string:

  -DKICAD_REPO_NAME=stable -DKICAD_BUILD_VERSION=4.0.4

This is not longer needed. This note is kept until the next release.


== Building KiCad

Instructions can be found in compiling.md which is located in the kicad source code under /Documentation/development folder.

Alternatively, you can view it online here: link:http://docs.kicad-pcb.org/doxygen/md_Documentation_development_compiling.html[Building KiCad from Source]

KiCad 4.0.5, 4.0.6, and 4.0.7 cannot be compiled with boost 1.61 and higher
since the latter requires C{plus}{plus}11. If you insist to use boost 1.61 and
higher, you can apply link:http://kicad-pcb.org/boost-1.61.patch[this patch]
manually and compile with a C{plus}{plus}11 capable compiler and its appropriate
compiler switches.

Do not use the https://github.com/KiCad/KicadOSXBuilder[KicadOSXBuilder] as it is outdated.
