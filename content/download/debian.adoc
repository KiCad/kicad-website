The current upstream release 4.0.2 is available for Debian
https://packages.debian.org/stretch/kicad[testing/sid].

=== Debian Stable (Jessie)

Current Version: *bzr4027* (KiCad stable release 2014), or *4.0.2* via Backports

The 2014 stable release bzr4027 of KiCad is available in the official Debian
repositories for https://packages.debian.org/jessie/kicad[stable/jessie].
It is not recommended for new designs. Please use the packages from the
backport repository for actual versions. Follow the instructions on the
https://wiki.debian.org/Backports[Debian Wiki] to add the Backport repository
to your sources and install the KiCad packages from
https://packages.debian.org/jessie-backports/kicad[jessie-backports].

=== Debian Old-Stable (Wheezy)

Current version: *bzr3261* (KiCad stable release 2012), or *bzr4027* via
Backports

Unfortunately there is only release bzr3261 from 2012 in the old-stable
repository and version bzr4027 (this is the same as on current stable) in the
old-stable-backport repository. As for Debian stable, it's recommend for new
designs. So you better upgrade your Debian installation to Debian Stable
(Jessie) and use the version there from backport.

=== Build from Source
You can find the instructions to build from source
link:http://ci.kicad-pcb.org/job/kicad-doxygen/ws/Documentation/doxygen/html/md_Documentation_development_compiling.html#build_linux[here].
If you have a running Debian stable with actual packages from Backports or you
running a testing/sid release you can compile your own version of KiCad. Ensure
you have installed some build dependencies at least before:

[source.bash]
sudo apt-get install libwxbase3.0-dev libwxgtk3.0-dev libgl1-mesa-dev \
libglew-dev libglm-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libboost-dev libboost-thread-dev \
libcairo2-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-context-dev libssl-dev wx-common
