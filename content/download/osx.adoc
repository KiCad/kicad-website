=== Recent Builds
Nightly builds of KiCad for OS X are available on http://downloads.kicad-pcb.org/osx/, built by Adam Wolf.  KiCad is supported on OS X 10.7 through OS X 10.11.

These are the "nightly" builds.  This means they are snapshots of the codebase at that time, and may contain even more bugs than usual, although we try our best.

The kicad.dmg files include the KiCad suite, documentation, schematic symbols, and some templates.  It gets footprints from the internet.

kicad-extras.dmg contains the footprints and all the instructions you need for making printed circuit board layouts while offline.


=== Build from Source
Instructions for building from source is in http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~kicad-product-committers/kicad/product/view/head:/Documentation/compiling/mac-osx.txt[mac-osx.txt]. 
Do not use the https://github.com/KiCad/KicadOSXBuilder[KicadOSXBuilder] as it is outdated.
