=== 4.0.3 Stable Release

Current Version: *4.0.3*

KiCad for OS X is available as two disk image (dmg) files.

The kicad.dmg file includes the KiCad suite, documentation, schematic symbols, and some templates.  It gets footprints from the internet.

 - http://downloads.kicad-pcb.org/osx/stable/kicad-extras-4.0.3.dmg[KiCad extras]

You usually want to install both disk images.

=== Nightly Development Builds
Nightly development builds of KiCad for OS X are available at http://downloads.kicad-pcb.org/osx/, built by Adam Wolf.  KiCad is supported on OS X 10.7 through OS X 10.11.

These are the "nightly" builds.  This means they are snapshots of the codebase at that time, and may contain even more bugs than usual, although we try our best.

=== Build from Source
You can find the instructions to build from source link:http://ci.kicad-pcb.org/job/kicad-doxygen/ws/Documentation/doxygen/html/md_Documentation_development_compiling.html#build_osx[here]. 

Do not use the https://github.com/KiCad/KicadOSXBuilder[KicadOSXBuilder] as it is outdated.
