== 5.0.1 Stable Release

[WARNING]
Please note that a last minute bug was found in the Eagle schematic
import feature too late to be fixed in this release which is expected
to be fixed in release 5.0.2.  If you need to convert Eagle schematics
you may want to hold off upgrading until 5.0.2.

=== Installation

KiCad 5.0.1 is available in https://launchpad.net/~js-reynaud/+archive/ubuntu/kicad-5[js-reynaud's KiCad 5.0 PPA].

To install KiCad via the PPA, you can use the Software Manager:

1. Open the Ubuntu Software Manager.
2. Select 'Edit' -> 'Software Sources...'.
3. Open the 'Other Software' tab.
4. Click 'Add...', and enter the PPA address: `ppa:js-reynaud/kicad-5` and then click the 'Add Source' button.
5. When prompted insert the administrator user password.
6. Return to the Software Manager and view the Progress tab to see when the cache has finished updating.
7. Return to the Software Manager main screen, search for 'kicad', and install it.

The KiCad schematic library and docs are in separate packages. If you want either of these install kicad-library and kicad-doc respectively.

If you prefer to use the shell, you can enter these commands into a terminal:

[source,bash]
sudo add-apt-repository --yes ppa:js-reynaud/kicad-5
sudo apt update
sudo apt install kicad

=== Migration from legacy nightly build

Users of the legacy nightly build have to remove KiCad packages before
trying to install version 5.0. The legacy nightly build will be always newer than
version 5.0.
To remove the legacy nightly build:

[source,bash]
sudo apt-get remove kicad kicad-footprints kicad-libraries
sudo apt-get remove kicad-symbols kicad-templates  kicad-packages3d
sudo apt-get remove kicad-doc-* kicad-locale-*
sudo add-apt-repository -r ppa:js-reynaud/ppa-kicad

Then perform the installation of the stable released as described above this section

== Nightly Development Builds
Nightly builds are provided in a separate installation directory. It is
possible to install nightly builds at the same time as a stable version (5.0 for example).

Nightly development builds are available in
https://launchpad.net/~js-reynaud/+archive/ubuntu/kicad-dev-nightly[js-reynaud's nightly PPA].
These provide the latest, unreleased preview of KiCad.
To install KiCad via the PPA, you can use the Ubuntu Software Manager:

1. Open the Ubuntu Software Manager.
2. Select 'Edit' -> 'Software Sources...'.
3. Open the 'Other Software' tab.
4. Click 'Add...', and enter the PPA address: `ppa:js-reynaud/kicad-dev-nightly` and then click the 'Add Source' button.
5. When prompted insert the administrator user password.
6. Return to the Software Manager and view the Progress tab to see when the cache has finished updating.
7. Return to the Software Manager main screen, search for 'kicad-nightly', and install it.

If you prefer to use the shell, you can enter these commands into a terminal:

[source,bash]
sudo add-apt-repository --yes ppa:js-reynaud/kicad-dev-nightly
sudo apt update
sudo apt install kicad-nightly
# You can also install debug symbols:
sudo apt install kicad-nightly-dbg
# Demo
sudo apt install kicad-nightly-demo
# and libraries
sudo apt install kicad-nightly-footprints kicad-nightly-libraries kicad-nightly-packages3d kicad-nightly-symbols kicad-nightly-templates

To launch nightly version of a kicad's binaries, you have to add "-nightly" to the
command name:

- kicad -> kicad-nightly
- pcbnew -> pcbnew-nightly
- eeschema -> eeschema-nightly
- ...
