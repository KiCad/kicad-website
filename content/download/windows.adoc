== Stable Release

Current Version: *5.0.1*

[WARNING]
Please note that a last minute bug was found in the Eagle schematic
import feature too late to be fixed in this release which is expected
to be fixed in release 5.0.2.  If you need to convert Eagle schematics
you may want to hold off upgrading until 5.0.2.
