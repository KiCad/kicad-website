== Stable Release

{{< repology fedora_rawhide >}}

{{< repology fedora_32 >}}

{{< repology fedora_31 >}}

{{< repology fedora_30 >}}

In general, latest Fedora releases ship the stable versions of KiCad as they are
released.

To install the most recent stable KiCad package on Fedora simply search for it
in the Software app or open a terminal and run the following command:

[source,bash]
dnf install kicad

In case the latest KiCad release is not yet available in the updates repository,
chances are you'll find it in the testing repository. Run the following command
to install a testing package:

[source,bash]
dnf --enablerepo=updates-testing install kicad

As of KiCad 5.0.0, the 3D models have been moved to a separate package and can
be installed with:

[source,bash]
dnf install kicad-packages3d


== Nightly Development Builds

The _nightly development_ builds are snapshots of the development (master branch) codebase at a specific time.
This codebase is under active development, and while we try our best, may contain more bugs than usual.
New features added to KiCad can be tested in these builds.

WARNING: These builds may be unstable, and projects edited with these may not be usable with the current stable release. **Use at your own risk**

IMPORTANT: Stable and nightly builds cannot be installed on the same Fedora system.

Nightly development builds for Fedora are available via the
link:https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/g/kicad/kicad/[copr build service], and can be installed on Fedora with:

[source,bash]
dnf copr enable @kicad/kicad
dnf install kicad

The kicad package includes the latest revision of all libraries except for the
3D models from the
link:https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-packages3D[kicad-packages3D] repository.
Because of their size of more than 4 GB on disk they have been moved to a
separate package and can be installed with:

[source,bash]
dnf install kicad-packages3d

If you don't have copr, install it with:

[source,bash]
dnf install dnf-plugins-core
