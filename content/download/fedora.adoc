=== Recent Builds
	
Daily builds for Fedora are available via the copr build service.

This build can be installed on fedora with:

----
dnf copr enable mangelajo/kicad
dnf install kicad
----

If you don't have copr install with:

----
yum install dnf-plugins-core
----

As a side note, the wxwidgets build in the copr build is forcing `--with=gtk2` on wxgtk, otherwise eeschema and the legacy canvas does not work properly. 
This could be problematic if you have other applications depending on wxgtk already. This is a workaround so far to bring KiCad to fedora easily.
