=== Stable Release
In general, latest Fedora releases ship the stable versions KiCad as they are
released.

To install the most recent stable KiCad package on Fedora simply search for it
in the Software app or open a terminal and run the following command:

[source,bash]
dnf install kicad

In case the latest KiCad release is not yet available in the updates repository,
chances are you'll find it in the testing repository. Run the following command
to install a testing package:

[source,bash]
dnf --enablerepo=updates-testing install kicad

=== Nightly Development Builds

Nightly development builds for Fedora are available via the

----
dnf copr enable mangelajo/kicad
dnf install kicad
----

If you don't have copr install with:

----
