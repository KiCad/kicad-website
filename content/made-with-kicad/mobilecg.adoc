MobilECG is an USB-based open source 12-lead clinical electrocardiograph.

It is designed to meet all the relevant medical standards (ISO 60601-1, etc.).
Smaller than most ECGs on the market, and also has superior signal quality.
Works with PCs, notebooks, and Android tablets. Records all leads simultaneously.
