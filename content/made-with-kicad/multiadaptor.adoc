This adaptor has multiple overlapping footprints for any occasion: up to 28 pin
SOIC/SO (1.27mm pitch), up to 28-pin SSOP/TSSOP (0.65mm pitch), up to four SOT23,
up to three SC70, one MSOP-10 (0.5mm pitch), one SOT223, and one SOT-143.
All in a 0.8" wide DIP board. The header pins are staggered to allow press-fitting
them while soldering.
