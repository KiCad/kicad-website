The Opsis is a powerful FPGA-based open source video platform for videographers
and visual artists and designed to give the user complete control over
high-speed video, enabling everything from real-time conference capturing
solutions, to experimental visual art and even general FPGA-based video
research.

Created in collaboration between the http://numato.com[Numato Lab] and
http://code.timvideos.us[TimVideos.us live event streaming project], the Opsis
is the ideal device for the http://hdmi2usb.tv[HDMI2USB.tv] video capturing
firmware, which allows for “fool-proof” video recording from any computer.
