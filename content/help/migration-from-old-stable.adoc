There is likely to be some issues if you want to migrate designs from the old stable, revision around bzr revision 4022, which had a particular annoying bug, where layer names were translated, which they should never have been.

== Layernames are translated

This issue arises if you used the old stable with another language other than English. Below is the key for renaming the layers manually, showing how the layernames were in Italian and French. You will not only need to replace the layers list, but also search and replace on all the names in the file.

== Schematic libraries are updated

Be aware that the schematic libries has gotten an overhaul (still in
progress), which means that it will easily break your schematics,
because the bundled libs takes precedence over the cache lib. What you
can do to recover is to remove the libs used in the project and rename
the cache lib file, and include that instead. Chris Pavlina has
recently made a wizard to help with this issue, this has been merged
in the product branch now.
