== Before you begin
Reporting an issue with KiCad requires identifying the correct location the issue belongs to known as a *repository* or *repo*.

However, before reporting a issue in any repository:

. Please make best effort to locate any existing issue that may be a duplicate of your problem
before starting a new issue.


. On the *New Issue* page if you see a prefilled description like this example:
+
image::/img/help/new-issue-form-desc.png[alt="Example of new issue form description field"]
+
Please do your absolute best to fill in the issue per contents of the description and respond to any additional requests for information.
It helps both you and developers to resolve issues.


== Reporting Locations

=== KiCad (applications)
If you have a functional issue with using any application be it the project launcher (KiCad),
schematic editor (Eeschema), pcb editor (Pcbnew), Gerber viewer (gerbview) and other executables.

=== Translations (for the applications)
KiCad applications by default have all of their interface text written in English. A group of contributors creates special translation files
to convert the English text to other languages.

=== Documentation (any language)
All the documentation is made up a team of contributors that spend their time painstakingly keeping content up to date with KiCad's changes.
Additionally contributors also spend time translating the same manuals into other languages.

=== Website
The website is maintained by another group of maintainers. The main website at kicad-pcb.org is separate from the documentation website
docs.kicad-pcb.org. Please report any issues in the correct location.

== Support/Help Requests
Issue trackers are not for general support requests asking how do you use or do something in KiCad.

We ask you instead look at the link:/community/sites/[community forums links] for communities that can provide help.
