Newer versions of KiCad bring changes to file formats and functionality. While effort is made to maintain compatibility, there may ultimately be changes that must made
in existing projects to adapt to the changes.

== Migration from 4.0 to 5.0
Information on upgrading from 4.0 to 5.0 can be found in the 
http://docs.kicad-pcb.org/stable/en/kicad.html#_upgrading_from_version_4_to_version_5[KiCad help manual].


== Migration from any version before 4.0 (also known as "old-stable") to 4.0

There is likely to be some issues if you want to migrate designs from the old stable, revision around bzr revision 4022, which had a particular annoying bug, where layer names were translated, which they should never have been.

=== Layernames are translated

This issue arises if you used a "old stable" version with a language other than English.

You need to edit all `.kicad_pcb` files with a text editor (notepad, ...) and change the layer names from Italian/French to their English counterparts. Below is the correspondance of the layer names. Caution: there are more instances to replace than just the layer list. Be sure that you don't miss any.

=== Schematic libraries are updated

Be aware that the schematic libries has gotten an overhaul (still in
progress), which means that it will easily break your schematics,
because the bundled libs takes precedence over the cache lib. What you
can do to recover is to remove the libs used in the project and rename
the cache lib file, and include that instead. Chris Pavlina has
recently made a wizard to help with this issue, this has been merged
in the product branch now.
