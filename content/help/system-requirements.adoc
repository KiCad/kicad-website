== Common System Requirements (hardware specs)

* Pentium-compatible PC (Pentium IV, Athlon or more-recent system recommended);

* 512 MB RAM (1024 MB RAM recommended);

* Up to 5GB available hard disk space;

* Screen resolution of 1024x768 works but, 1280x1024 or higher is recommended,
  with at least 16K colors (with 1024x768 some buttons may result hidden but
  corresponding commands should be reachable via menu anyway).

* Graphic card with at least OpenGL 2.1, with hardware shaders. Check
  the OpenGL specs of the card:
** Intel: no cards that came before the HD-Graphics series, regardless of the name including "HD".
   Intel cards that are reported working starts from model HD2000 and higher.
** NVIDIA: from NVIDIA support page: http://www.nvidia.com/object/nv_ogl2_support.html
   NVIDIA support for OpenGL 2.0 begins with the Release 75 series of drivers.
   GeForce FX (NV3x), GeForce 6 Series (NV4x), NV3xGL-based Quadro FX and NV4xGL-based
   Quadro FX GPUs, and all future NVIDIA GPUs support OpenGL 2.0.
** AMD/ATI: should work any modern Radeon GPU, but check for some issues here:

== Common System Requirements (software specs)

See: http://kicad-pcb.org/help/known-system-related-issues/ for software specific issues.

== Specific System Requirements

KiCad supports major operating systems that remain supported by their developers.  After the operating systems'
respective companies stop releasing updates for the system, KiCad will not be specifically tested with the
old system.  Older operating systems may continue to work with KiCad beyond this time but bugs must be reproduced on a supported operating system before they will be addressed by KiCad.

=== Windows

The software prerequisites for installing KiCad on a Windows
system are as follows:

|Operating System|End of Support
|Windows 7|14-Jan-2020
|Windows 8|Unsupported

=== Apple - macOS

The software prerequisites for installing on a macOS system are as follows:

=== GNU/Linux

The following Linux distribution versions have been tested and are known to be working.
Issues or bugs that occur on an unsupported platform must be
reproduced on an officially supported distribution and window manager before they will
be addressed by KiCad.

==== Tested Distributions

|Operating System|End of Support:
|Ubuntu 16.04|1-Apr-2019
|Ubuntu 17.10|Not Supported
|Ubuntu 18.04|1-Apr-2023
|Ubuntu 18.10|1-Apr-2019
|Debian 9 (Stretch)|approx 2020
|Debian 10 (Buster)|approx 2022
|Fedora 29|approx May 2019

==== Additional Linux Considerations
Linux also allows the user to select their window manager.  There are many esoteric
window managers available for Linux and some may have unexpected behavior.  KiCad officially
supports the following window managers:

* Metacity (used by GNOME 2 and GNOME flashback)
* Mutter (when used with an X11 backend)
* KWin (when used with an X11 backend)
* Xfwm (used by XFCE)

==== Graphical Windowing Backend
KiCad officially supports the X11 backend.  Users who choose to use Wayland will run in
a compatibility layer called link:https://wayland.freedesktop.org/xserver.html[XWayland].

Issues or bugs encountered while using XWayland must be reproduced under X11 before they
will be addressed by KiCad.


=== Other OSes

Other systems (notably Unix *BSD) may be fully functional but are not officially supported.
