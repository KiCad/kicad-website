== Before you begin
KiCad is composed of a few separate parts that come together as the application.
Each part resides in what is known as a repository and you must identify the correct one to post a issue to.


However, before reporting a issue in any repository:

. Please make best effort to locate any existing issue that may be a duplicate of your problem
before starting a new issue.


. On the *New Issue* page if you see a prefilled description like this example:
+
image::/img/help/new-issue-form-desc.png[alt="Example of new issue form description field"]
+
Please do your absolute best to fill in the issue per contents of the description. 
It helps both you and developers to resolve issues.
Incomplete issues may be ignored or closed outright.


== Repositories

=== KiCad (applications)
If you have a functional issue with using any application be it the project launcher (KiCad),
schematic editor (Eeschema), pcb editor (Pcbnew), Gerber viewer (gerbview) and other executables.

The correct issue repository is located https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/issues[here] 

=== Translations (for the applications)
KiCad applications by default have all of their interface text written in English. A group of contributors creates special translation files
to convert the English text to other languages. 

If there is any issue with a translation or even a missing translation, please report is https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad-i18n/issues[here]

=== Documentation (any language)
All the documentation is made up a team of contributors that spend their time painstakingly keeping content up to date with KiCad's changes.
Additionally contributors also spend time translating the same manuals into other languages.

If there are issues with any content in a manual in any language including English, please report it https://gitlab.com/kicad/services/kicad-doc[here] 

=== Website
The website is maintained by another group of maintainers. 

Any issues with the docs website (docs.kicad-pcb.org) should be reported https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-doc-website[here]
Any issues with the main website (kicad-pcb.org) should be reported here https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-website[here]


== Usage Support Requests
Issue trackers are not for general support requests relating to how do you use or do something in KiCad.

You should instead look at the link:/community/sites/[community forums links] for communities that can provide help.
