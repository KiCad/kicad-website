It is already a week since 5.0 has been released, meaning it is a good moment
to sum up the release.

Many Windows users have reported problems, most frequently related to wxWidgets
assert dialogs showing up in pcbnew. The problem has been resolved, therefore
if you still experience any issues please reinstall KiCad using the current
Windows installer.

There is still one problem that has appeared very late in the 5.0 release
cycle: Python scripting support in recent Linux systems. Since some time
wxPython packages are based on GTK3 which causes a lot of problems in KiCad.
Due to that, we were forced to disable Python scripting in many KiCad packages.
We feel sorry about that, but we want you to know that fixing the scripting
support has received top priority. This is the main goal of the 5.1 release
that we estimate to have ready around November. After that we will start
merging feature branches in the 6.0 development cycle.

Last, but not least: the donation campaign. It was hard to miss it, and frankly
speaking - we are amazed by the donation flow! We have already reached our goal
in a week time and the donor counter does not stop. It is another time when
KiCad community proves to be very active and caring. Thank you all!
