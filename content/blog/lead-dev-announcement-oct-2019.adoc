I don't normally post blog announcements in the first person but I'm going to make an
exception since this is rather important.  This will also be my first blog post that isn't
good news.  I guess it was bound to happen sooner or later.  I regret to inform everyone
that I found out earlier this month that my employment with WIT will be terminated effective
October 31st.  I am not at liberty to discuss the details as to why my employment was terminated
but can say that I had nothing to do with the decision.  I know that it's not the best situation
in the world for the project or me personally but I am going to do everything in my power to
continue to work full time on KiCad.  In the short term, I will continue working on KiCad while
pursuing as many avenues as possible to generate enough revenue to allow me to continue to work
full time on KiCad.  You should expect more announcements in the not to distant future.  The
long term prospects are not as clear so I will keep everyone informed as I know more.  Thank
you everyone for your continued support of the KiCad project.

Cheers,

Wayne
