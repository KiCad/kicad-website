The first ever Learn to Code KiCad event happened in Brussels, BE
on Friday, Jan 31.  We had 15 new KiCad developers from Europe and
the United States in attendance.  12 unique issues were addressed
by the participants, ranging from OpenGL display on ARM hardware
to cursor offset bugs to Eeschema rubberbanding.

Wayne, Ian, Jon and Seth served as sounding boards for user questions
and provided some guidance on where to find needed information.

At the end, we had a couple of merge requests and much progress from
a motivated team of future contributors.
