The KiCad project is excited to announce that the project has joined the
https://www.linuxfoundation.org/[Linux Foundation].  This has the potential
to provide additional avenues for donations to the KiCad project.  It will
also allow the project to use donations for services other than software
development.  Our current donation arrangement with https://home.cern/[CERN]
will continue as it always has so you can continue to donate via CERN if you
prefer.  This will give donors a choice of donation platforms.  If you are
interested in donating to KiCad via the Linux Foundation, please donate
through our
https://funding.communitybridge.org/projects/kicad[Linux Foundation Community Bridge Portal].

Thank you for your continued support of the KiCad project as we explore this
new avenue to fund development of KiCad.

The KiCad Project.
