The KiCad project is proud to announce that the official KiCad libraries
are now featured on the link:/libraries/download[KiCad website].

The library team has invested a large amount of time improving the
standard of the KiCad libraries. As part of this effort, a new
set of KiCad Library Conventions (KLC) are now available on the
KiCad website at link:/libraries/klc[/libraries/klc].

These conventions help to ensure that contributions to the libraries
are held to a high standard. The KiCad project aims to provide a
comprehensive set of libraries "out of the box".

To provide a simple method of downloading the latest library data,
the KiCad libraries are now also available for download at
link:https://kicad.github.io[kicad.github.io]. Libraries are
rebuilt weekly, and track the library repositories on
link:https://github.com/KiCad[GitHub].

As always, the strength of the KiCad libraries relies on user
contributions. To assist with library development, refer to
link:/libraries/contribute[the contribution guide].

The KiCad project hope that users find the libraries useful,
and that with continued community engagement, the quality can
only continue to improve.
