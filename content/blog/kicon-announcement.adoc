The KiCad project is excited to announce the first ever KiCad Conference
https://kicad-kicon.com/[(KiCon)] in Chicago from April 26th through the
27th.  The conference will be held at the https://mhubchicago.com/[mHub].
This conference is geared towards KiCad users.  There will be lots of
talks from users of all skill levels as well as some of the members of the
https://launchpad.net/~kicad-product-committers[KiCad Lead Development Team].
The conference keynote talk will be given by the KiCad project leader.

Come join enthusiastic KiCad users and developers from all over the world
for a fun and informative two full days of all things KiCad.  On top of

ideas and get to know other users and members of the development team.
