The KiCad project is proud to announce the latest series 5 stable
release of KiCad.  The 5.1.2 stable version contains critical bug
fixes and other minor improvements since the 5.1.0 release.  It
also includes improved footprint, symbol, and 3D model libraries,
translations, and documentation.  A list of all of the fixed bugs
since the 5.1.0 release can be found on the
https://launchpad.net/kicad/+milestone/5.1.2[KiCad 5.1.2 milestone page].
This release contains several critical bug fixes so please consider
upgrading as soon as possible.

If you are wondering why there was no "official" 5.1.1 release,
there was a serious issue after 5.1.1 was tagged and some users
had downloaded the unreleased 5.1.1 builds from the KiCad build
server.  The only way to prevent install conflicts was to create
a new 5.1.2 tag with the bug fix and spin new builds.  The KiCad
project would like to apologize for any inconvenience this may
have caused.

Version 5.1.2 is made from the
https://code.launchpad.net/~kicad-product-committers/kicad/+git/product-git/+ref/5.1[lp:kicad/5.1]
branch with some cherry picked changes from the development branch.

Packages for Windows, MacOS, and Linux are available or will be
in the very near future.  See the
link:/download[KiCad download page] for guidance.

Thank you to all developers, packagers, librarians, document writers,
translators, and everyone else who helped make this release possible.
