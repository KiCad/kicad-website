For those of you who did not have the good fortune of being able to attend
https://kicad-kicon.com/[KiCon], you missed a great conference.  If this
years conference was any indication, you will not want to miss the next one.
The conference completely sold out with 220 registrations.  Attendees from
all over the world gathered to share their experiences with KiCad.  There
were high quality talks, the badges were cool, everything ran smoothly,
https://mhubchicago.com/[mHUB] was the ideal venue, and the after hours
events were a whole lot of (maybe too much) fun.  There was a tremendous
amount of excitement about all things KiCad which bodes well for the future.

If you couldn't attend, the https://youtu.be/nL0yTvJKA5c[keynote talk] and
https://youtu.be/NRwTyBX2BFk[developer panel talk] have been uploaded to
YouTube.  All of the talk videos are in the process of being uploaded so
you will be able to view all of them.  You should also take a look at
https://hackaday.com/2019/04/30/kicad-community-shines-at-first-ever-kicon/[Mike Szczys' Hack-A-Day Post]
for a nice write up on KiCon.

The KiCad project would like to thank Chris Gammel for all of the hard work
he did to make KiCon happen.  We would also like to thank all of our
https://kicad-kicon.com/sponsors/[sponsors], presenters, and volunteers who
made KiCon possible.

The first KiCon was so good that you may want to get your tickets early for
the next KiCon before it sells out.  We hope to see all of you at the next
KiCon.
