As a preview of a feature coming in the next major release, the ability to import Altium PcbDoc files is now
available in the latest nightly builds. This was thanks to the work of https://gitlab.com/pointhi[Thomas Pointhuber
] in https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/merge_requests/60[MR#60]

The board import option can be found under the File > Import Non-Kicad Board File option and changing the file type filter
