After almost a year after the release of KiCad 4.0.7, the KiCad
development team is proud to present a new and improved KiCad 5.0
release!

The stable release version 5.0.0 is made from the
https://git.launchpad.net/kicad/log/?h=5.0[stable 5.0] branch.

KiCad binaries should be available now or in the very near future for
download for Windows, macOS and Linux.  See the
http://kicad-pcb.org/download/[download page] for guidance.

Instructions for packagers can be found on
http://kicad-pcb.org/download/source/[the download page describing how
to build from source ]. Below are also some packaging
<<packaging-changes,packaging related changes>> since the 4.0 releases.

The official KiCad libraries have also seen a lot of improvement in
managment, style and consistency by the librarians.  Read more about
this on the http://kicad-pcb.org/libraries/download/[new library
section on the website.]

Thank you to all developers, packagers, librarians, document writers,
translators, and everyone else who helped make this release possible.

We hope you enjoy version 5 of KiCad.

NOTE: The macOS installer is not quite ready. There are a few minor
issues that needs to be addressed.

== Packaging Changes
In regard to packaging the KiCad binaries, not a lot has changed.  You
should mostly be able to bump the package version, but some new major
dependencies have been added with the SPICE similation and support for
IGES and STEP 3D models. We now depend on Open Cascade (by
default OCE, but OCCT should also work.) We also now depend upon 
ngspice built as a library.

Beyond dependencies, the library has had a major restructuring such that the
footprints are in one git repository and the templates have been seperated
out to its own repo as well. See http://kicad-pcb.org/download/source/
for all relevant information.
