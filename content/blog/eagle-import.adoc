The KiCad project is proud to announce the support for importing Eagle
projects. This is the outcome of work to complete the Eagle schematic file
plugin and integrate it with the Eagle board file plugin.

From the new "Import Project" menu entry in the KiCad launcher users may now
select an Eagle schematic or board file and the new project name and location,
after which the corresponding Eagle files will be imported respectively into
EEschema and PcbNew.

The import plugins are now available for testing in the nightly builds and will
be included in the version 5 release.

This work has been made possible by generous donations to the
link:https://giving.web.cern.ch/civicrm/contribute/transact?reset=1&id=6[CERN &
Society Foundation] in support of the KiCad Project. Special acknowledgements go
to Alejandro Garcia Montoro and Russell Oliver for the effort they put into the
development.
