It is time. Wayne, the current project leader, has now called the
development status a feature freeze. See the
https://lists.launchpad.net/kicad-developers/msg17606.html[announcement].

This is to satisfy the road map and finally make a real release of
KiCad since the latest release, the so called "Old Stable" also knows
as the "4022 release". The number is referring to the bazaar revision
number for that release.

The task is now to make KiCad stable, which means

fixing].

Bugs that needs fixing for a release are the bugs marked with high or
critical importance. http://goo.gl/wsQPgH[High and critical bugs].
