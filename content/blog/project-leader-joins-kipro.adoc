The KiCad project is excited to announce the project leader, Wayne Stambaugh,
has joined the https://www.kipro-pcb.com/[KiCad Services Corporation].  A
https://youtu.be/X4wMtCqVUQE[video interview] with KiCad Services Corporation
founder Seth Hillbrand is available for viewing.  This new position will allow
the project leader to continue work on KiCad as much as possible when not
working on behalf of the corporation.  On behalf of The KiCad development team
and its users, we would like to say thank you to the KiCad Services Corporation
for its commitment to the project.  We are looking forward to the continue
development manpower this will provide and we hope we can help the KiCad Services
Corporation achieve its goals.
