We are happy to announce a new website for KiCad, this instead of the
old website system which was using Confluence, that has proved very
unstable.

The goal of this new website is to be the go to place for official
KiCad information and should support some way of having regular KiCad
users contribute to the site, let that be fixing typing mistakes or
just improving the content in what ever way seems fit.

This time around we have taken a new approach, instead of using the
monster of confluence, we have choosen http://gohugo.io[Hugo], a
static site generator. This should make sure that the requirements for
the hosting server is quite low, and should help increasing the
availability of the site. Although KiCad itself does not run on mobile
devices (think smartphones and the like) the website should be way
more appealing on these platforms too.
