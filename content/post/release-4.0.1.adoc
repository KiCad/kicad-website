+++

A new release of KiCad has been made, containing some minor bug fixes.

These are related to the default path issue seen on Windows where the
`KISYMOD` and `KISYS3DMOD` was not set properly. They are now set as
environment variables by the installer such that they match your
installation directory.

In addition to that, a few fixes for the GAL canvas has been applied
and a bug fix for the KiCad manager where it could potentially crash.

Version 4.0.1 is made from the
link:https://code.launchpad.net/~stambaughw/kicad/4.0[lp:kicad/4.0]
branch with some cherry picked changes from the development branch.

KiCad binaries will be available for download for Windows, OSX and
Linux in the near future, see the link:../../download[download page]
for guidance.

Instructions for packagers can be found on
link:../../download/source/[the download page describing how to build
from source] and its subpages.
