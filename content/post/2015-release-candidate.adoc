== Cvpcb behaivour change
Cvpcb can is no longer a stand alone executable. It is now run as a child window from Eeschema. This was done because using the footprint association file (*.cmp) is no longer used, running it as a stand alone executable would be meaningless. The transfer of footprint associations is internal to Eeschema. Remove any Cvpcb application links from your system. They are no longer valid.
