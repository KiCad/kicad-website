We are pleased to announce that
link:https://lists.launchpad.net/kicad-developers/msg20326.html[KiCad has
finally made a 2015 release branch].
The 2015 stable release of KiCad will start from version *4.0.0*.
Currently we are in the release candidate phase and as such *BZR 6188*
is now known as  *4.0.0 RC1*.

The 4.0 branch can be found here:
link:https://code.launchpad.net/~stambaughw/kicad/4.0[KiCad 4.0 Branch]

The RC1 branch has been packaged as a archive available here:
link:https://launchpad.net/kicad/4.0/4.0.0-rc1/+download/kicad-4.0.0-rc1.tar.xz[KiCad 4.0.0 RC1 Archive]

The new GUI translations can be found in the 
link:https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-i18n/[kicad-i18n]
repository on github.

== Binaries

In addition to the source code, the following binary downloads are available:

 - link:/download/windows/[Windows]
 - link:/download/linux-mint/[Linux Mint]
 - link:/download/ubuntu/[Ubuntu 14.04 and Ubuntu 15]
 
OSX and additional Linux packages are coming as soon as maintainers
package them! Please check back at a later time.

There is still no timeline on a final 4.0.0 release. We are asking
developers to continue helping to fix existing bugs within KiCad.  As
of the time of this post, the product (development) branch is *not
accepting new features* until the release of KiCad 4.0.  Only bug
fixes and polishing of existing features will be accepted.
