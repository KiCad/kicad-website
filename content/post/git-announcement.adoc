The moment all of you https://git-scm.com/[Git] fans have been waiting for
has finally arrived!  As of August 21st, 2016 the official development
repository for KiCad is now Git instead of http://bazaar.canonical.com/[Bazaar].
The decision was made to stick with https://launchpad.net/[Launchpad] as the
hosting site rather than move to https://github.com/[Github] in order to keep
our existing bug tracker history.  The development team decided that the Lauchpad
Git integration had reached a sufficient level of maturity to make the switch.
You can now directly clone the KiCad product branch using:

------------------------------------------
git clone https://git.launchpad.net/kicad
------------------------------------------

Hopefully there will be minimal issues as we move forward using Git.  Please be
patient as we integrate Git into our normal routine.  For help configuring Git
for Lauchpad, please see the https://help.launchpad.net/Code/Git[Git help page on Launchpad].

Happy version controlling!

The KiCad development team.
