After almost 15 months in development and testing, the new 3DViewer
developed by Mario Luzeiro has been merged with the product branch in
revision 6985 <http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~kicad-product-committers/kicad/product/revision/6985>
and has since been available in the nightly builds of KiCad.

This viewer was written entirely from scratch and takes
advantage of the 3D plugin system to provide visualization
of all 3D model formats supported by available 3D plugins.

Features include:

* Two new render targets: OpenGL (GPU accelerated), and ray tracing
with post-processing effects.
* Takes full advantage of the new 3D plugins
<http://kicad-pcb.org/post/in-development-3d-plugins/> system - easier
path search and file assignment using environment variables.
* 3D model cache - fast 3D models loading.
* Faster board loading.
* The new OpenGL render is faster than the old one, specially while
moving the board - a noticeable feature if you are still using an old
GPU.
* New 3D plugins available: WRL, X3D, IDF.
* STEP and IGES support is available via the kicad_oce_3D plugin
<https://github.com/cbernardo/kicad_oce_3D>. This brings KiCad one
step closer to built-in MCAD export. UPDATE: This plugin has been
merged into kicad.
* Preview of 3D model while browsing the 3D file. See figure 1.
* 3D preview of the footprint while adding / aligning 3D shapes -
provides a real-time feedback on adjusting the values. See figure 2.
* Render of 3D models according to attributes: Normal, Normal+Insert,
Virtual. - Useful if you want to individually  show / hide THT or SMD
footprints or (as and example) mechanical shapes (eg: enclosures).
* Pivot rotation centered in one point over the PCB board. See figure 3.
* Animated camera while moving and rotating.

KiCad may be the first EDA tool to have an embedded ray
tracing render engine. Ray tracing is a physical based and
mathematical render method. Instead of using triangle approximations
for rendering the elements of the board it will use the true
mathematically defined elements; as an example it will render a hole
by subtracting a perfect cylinder, or it can render a via using a
perfect cylindrical ring.
The ray tracing algorithm provides shadows, reflections and refractions.
Additionally there is a post-processing shader to add an effect of
ambient occlusion and global illumination. See the figures 4 to 8.
