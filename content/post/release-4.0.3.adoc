A new stable release of KiCad has been released.  The 4.0.3 stable version

libraries. It does have the latest changes from the kicad-i18n repo,
which contains the GUI translations for KiCad.

The stable release version 4.0.3 is made from the

branch with bug fixes and improvements cherry picked from the
link:https://code.launchpad.net/~kicad-product-committers/kicad/product[development branch]
of KiCad.

KiCad binaries are available or will be available in the near future
for download for Windows, OSX and Linux, see the
