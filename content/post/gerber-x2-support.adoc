The KiCad project is pleased to announce that it is the first electronic development
application to fully support the Gerber X2 extensions.  See the
link:http://design.iconnect007.com/index.php/article/100982/ucamcos-gerber-netlist-goes-live-with-kicad/100985/?skin=design[article[article on the PCB Design website].  Thanks to the
efforts of project founder Jean-Pierre Charras, KiCad can provide full Gerber X2
extension support before any proprietary or open source electronic development
applications.  The Gerber X2 support is currently available in the nightly builds
of KiCad and will ship when the stable 5 version of KiCad is released.
