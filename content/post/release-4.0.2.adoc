date = "2016-02-28"
+++

A new release of KiCad has been made, containing only minor bug
fixes.

This release does not contain a new snapshot of the docs or libs. It
does have the latest changes from the kicad-i18n repo, which contains
the GUI translations for KiCad.

As last time, version 4.0.2 is made from the
link:https://code.launchpad.net/~stambaughw/kicad/4.0[lp:kicad/4.0]
branch with some cherry picked changes from the development branch.

KiCad binaries will be available for download for Windows, OSX and
Linux in the near future, see the link:../../download[download page]
for guidance.

Instructions for packagers can be found on
link:../../download/source/[the download page describing how to build from source] and its subpages.
