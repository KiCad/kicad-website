The KiCad project recently merged the symbol library table code for
accessing symbol libraries into the master branch.  This represents
a significant change in the way symbol libraries are defined and
accessed.  It is similar in design and function of the footprint
library table and will resolve the long standing issue with symbol
library ordering in Eeschema along with some new features such as
platform independence and lazy library loading.  KiCad users should
be familiar with the design and concept so this is not a tutorial
on how to configure your symbol library table.  It is important
information that you need to understand in order to properly
convert your existing schematics to use the symbol library table.

Much like the conversion over to the footprint library table, there
will be issues and a learning curve.  Hopefully, familiarity with
the footprint library table will minimize the learning curve.  The
biggest issues will be with existing projects and users with custom
symbol library configurations.  Some of these issue will be mitigated
by a new symbol library table remapping feature.  This feature will
be executed whenever a schematic is opened that has not yet been
remapped.  There are a few steps you should take ahead of time in
order for the remapping to be the most effective.

[WARNING]
Please note, the remapped schematics will not be compatible with older
version of KiCad so make sure to back your project schematic and project
files before remapping a schematic just in case things go wrong.


1. If you get warning about missing libraries when you start your current
   version of Eeschema, make sure to fix the missing libraries if they
   contained symbols that are in the schematic before you attempt to
   remap your schematic.  Otherwise, the correct symbol will not be found
   and you will end up with broken symbol links in your schematic.  You
   can test this by left clicking on a symbol in the schematic and verifying
   that the symbol is not being loaded from the cache library.  If a
   symbol is being loaded from the cache library, you are already skating
   on thin ice.

2. If you have been using a development build of KiCad, copy the full
   default global symbol library table (sym-lib-table) file from the
   template folder installed with the KiCad libraries or from the
   https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-library/blob/master/template/sym-lib-table[KiCad library repo]
   to your KiCad user configuration folder.  This will replace the
   empty one (most likely) created by Eeschema.  If you do not do
   this, you will most likely end up with a bunch of broken symbol
   links.

3. Make sure your default KiCad template project file (kicad.pro) has
   no entries in the [eeschema/libraries] section or get a copy from
   the
   https://git.launchpad.net/kicad/tree/template/kicad.pro[KiCad source repo].
   If you build from source or are using a nightly build, the update
   project template file has already been installed.  It is imperative
   that you do not have any symbol libraries in your project files.
   Otherwise, you could possible be effect by
   https://bugs.launchpad.net/kicad/+bug/937445[this] bug which the
   symbol library table is designed to resolve.

4. During the remapping process, symbol libraries not found in the global
   symbol library table will be used to create a project specific symbol
   library table.  You will have to move them manually to the global symbol
   library table if that is your preference.

5. For the most accurate remapping you should create a project library
   by copying the project cache file (project-name-cache.lib) to a different
   file and add it to the top of the symbol library list.  You must use a
   version of KiCad prior to the symbol library table implementation in
   order to do this.

Please be aware that there are also some minor behavioral changes with the
introduction of the symbol library table.

1. When removing the symbol from a library currently being edited in the
   library editor, the next symbol in the library is not automatically
   loaded so the canvas will be empty.  You will have to select a new symbol
   to edit.

2. The cache library is not longer shown in either the symbol library viewer
   or the symbol library editor.  The cache should have never be editable
   because any edits would get overwritten by the next schematic save.  The
   cache being removed from the symbol library viewer is a minor issue.
   Given that the cache library is going away when the new schematic file
   format is completed it was decided that it adding a lot of extra code for
   something that will soon be obsolete didn't make much sense.

This will be one of the last major code changes before the stable 5 release
feature freeze so please help test it so we can get the stable 5 release
out as soon as possible.  Thank you for your patience during this transition.
