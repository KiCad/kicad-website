The KiCad project is proud to announce the latest stable release of KiCad.
The 4.0.6 stable version contains critical bug fixes and other minor
improvements since the last release.  One other notable change was the
replacement of the link:https://github.com/avplayer/avhttp[Avhttp] library
with the link:https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/[libcurl] library when building
the link:https://github.com/[GitHub] plugin.  This should allow Linux
distributions that are not compatible with the
link:https://www.openssl.org/[OpenSSL] library license to distribute KiCad
with the GitHub plugin enabled.

The stable release version 4.0.6 is made from the
link:https://code.launchpad.net/~kicad-product-committers/kicad/+git/product-git/+ref/4.0[stable 4.0]
branch with bug fixes cherry picked from the
link:https://code.launchpad.net/~kicad-product-committers/kicad/+git/product-git/+ref/master[development branch]
of KiCad.

KiCad binaries are available or will be available in the near future for
download for Windows, OSX and Linux, see the
link:http://kicad-pcb.org/download/[download page] for guidance.

Instructions for packagers can be found on
http://kicad-pcb.org/download/source/[the download page describing how to build
from source] and its subpages.

Thank you to all developers, packagers, librarians, document writers,
translators, and everyone else who helped make this release possible.
