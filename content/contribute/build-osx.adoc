Building on OS X is very similar to building
on Linux. This document will provide a 
complete walk-through on what to do but it will
focus on OS X specific things. +
See general documentation on non OS X specific
KiCad build switches, etc.


== Prerequisites


=== Tools needed for building KiCad:
* XCode Tools
* bzr       - Bazaar version control system
* CMake     - Cross-platform make

=== Optional tools:
* Doxygen   - Documentation system for several programming languages

=== Mandatory library dependencies needed to compile KiCad:
* GLEW      - The OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library
* cairo     - 2D graphics library
* wxWidgets - Cross-Platform GUI Library +
   _OR_ +
  wxPython  - A blending of the wxWidgets pass:[C++] class library with the Python
              programming language
* SWIG      - Interface compiler (only needed for scripting/wxPython builds)

=== Optional library dependencies, depends on used KiCad features
* OpenSSL - The Open Source toolkit for SSL/TLS
  => Needed for github plugin

All tools (except XCode, of course) and all dependencies
except wxWidgets/wxPython can be compiled manually, but it is
advised to install them using your favorite package manager for
OS X like MacPorts or Homebrew.

Depending on the package manager the development packages of the
library dependencies may have to be installed (usually something
like <pkg>-dev or <pkg>-devel).

Further, depending on the configuration of your package manager
packages might have to be compiled with special flags/variants
to support the correct architecture. E.g., some packages of
MacPorts need to have the "`+universal`" variant set to also include
the x86_64 variant that might be chosen automatically by KiCad
build process.

IMPORTANT: At the moment you *must not* use a wxWidgets/wxPython version
installed by any package manager. +
KiCad on OS X needs overlay support and some other fixes, which
are not yet contained in mainline wxWidgets/wxPython sources and
builds. +
If you don't use a patched wxWidgets you will get graphical
artifacts (something like a magnifying glass effect in the upper
left corner of KiCad windows) or KiCad will just crash on start
(due to duplicate libraries).

Install now the tools and library dependencies as mentioned above.

== Folder Structure

This documentation will use the following folder structure as an
example, but it is not mandatory to do it like that:

 KiCad/ 
    +-- kicad/       KiCad source folder
    +-- build/       KiCad build folder
    +-- bin/         KiCad binaries folder
    +-- wx-src/      wxWidgets/wxPython source folder
    +-- wx-build/    wxWidgets/wxPython build folder
    +-- wx-bin/      wxWidgets/wxPython binaries folder

== Get KiCad sources

Create your work root "KiCad" wherever you like and sync KiCad
sources to it:

 # mkdir KiCad
 # cd KiCad
 # bzr branch lp:kicad

== Compiling wxWidgets / wxPython

If you don't intend to build KiCad with scripting support then
you only need wxWidgets, otherwise you need wxPython (which also
contains wxWidgets).

Get http://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/[wxWidgets sources] or
http://www.wxpython.org/download.php#source[ wxPython sources]
and unpack it to the `wx-src` folder.

It is recommended to use the latest stable version. As of this
writing this is 3.0.2 for wxWidgets or 3.0.1.1 for wxPython.

There is a little helper script 'osx_build_wx.sh' in kicad/scripts
that does all the patching/configuring/compiling of wxWidgets or
wxPython for you. +
Go to your working root "KiCad" and for example run:

 # kicad/scripts/osx_build_wx.sh wx-src wx-bin kicad 10.7 "-j4"

First parameter is the source folder of wxWidgets/wxPython, second
parameter the target folder for compiled binaries, and third
parameter is the kicad folder.
The fourth parameter is the minimum OS X version you are building
for (see the section about compiling KiCad for further notes on
minimum OS X version). +
The last parameter is optional and contains make options used during
the build (in this example for building with 4 jobs in parallel). +
The script will automatically detect if you are compiling wxWidgets
or wxPython.

NOTE: All paths are assumed to be relative to the current directory,
i.e., the working root you are in.

CAUTION: The script will erase existing wx-build and target folders
(wx-bin) without any confirmation!

If everything went fine during compilation you will now have a
working wxWidgets/wxPython installation in the wx-bin folder. +
For building KiCad it is sufficient to keep the wx-bin folder.

The script doesn't have to be used, the usual "configure/make/make
install" will also work. If you do so, be sure to apply the patches
needed for KiCad:

 # patch -p0 < ../kicad/patches/wxwidgets-3.0.0_macosx.patch
 # patch -p0 < ../kicad/patches/wxwidgets-3.0.0_macosx_bug_15908.patch
 # patch -p0 < ../kicad/patches/wxwidgets-3.0.0_macosx_soname.patch

The same patches apply both for wxWidgets and for wxPython.

There is also an optional patch that enables full screen resolution
on Retina displays:

 # patch -p0 < ../kicad/patches/wxwidgets-3.0.2_macosx_retina_opengl.patch

Optional patch to support pinch gesture on trackpads to control zoom:

 # patch -p0 < ../kicad/patches/wxwidgets-3.0.2_macosx_magnify_event.patch

The script uses the following configure command/options for
wxWidgets known to work:

  # ../wx-src/configure \
      --prefix=`pwd`/../wx-bin \
      --with-opengl \
      --enable-aui \
      --enable-utf8 \
      --enable-html \
      --enable-stl \
      --with-libjpeg=builtin \
      --with-libpng=builtin \
      --with-regex=builtin \
      --with-libtiff=builtin \
      --with-zlib=builtin \
      --with-expat=builtin \
      --without-liblzma \
      --with-macosx-version-min=<osxtarget> \
      --enable-universal-binary=i386,x86_64 \
      CC=clang \
      CXX=clang++

If you know what you are doing, you can of course use different
settings.

== Compiling KiCad

Change to your working root "KiCad" and create the build folder
there:

  # mkdir build
  # cd build

Now, configure KiCad without scripting support:

  # cmake ../kicad \
      -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang \
      -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ \
      -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.7 \
      -DwxWidgets_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE=../wx-bin/bin/wx-config \
      -DKICAD_SCRIPTING=OFF \
      -DKICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=OFF \
      -DKICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=OFF \
      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../bin \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

or, configure KiCad with scripting support:

  # cmake ../kicad \
      -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang \
      -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ \
      -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.7 \
      -DwxWidgets_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE=../wx-bin/bin/wx-config \
      -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=`which python` \
      -DPYTHON_SITE_PACKAGE_PATH=`pwd`/../wx-bin/lib/python2.7/site-packages \
      -DKICAD_SCRIPTING=ON \
      -DKICAD_SCRIPTING_MODULES=ON \
      -DKICAD_SCRIPTING_WXPYTHON=ON \
      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../bin \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

Note, that depending on your python version the "python2.7" part of
the "`-DPYTHON_SITE_PACKAGE_PATH`" variable might have to be
adjusted to what has been generated when compiling/installing
wxPython. If you want to use a specific python, you can also specify
it via "`-DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE`" instead of using 'which python'
(this one will just detect/use you default python).

The parameter "`-DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.x`" is mandatory,
you have to specify the (minimum) OS X version you intend to build
for. It is important that at least wxWidgets/wxPython and KiCad 
(and boost, if you use an external build) are built using the same
or compatible settings. If not, you might get linker errors, 
because this parameter influences which standard pass:[C++] library is
being used (pass:[libstdc++] vs. pass:[libc++]).

If you don't know what to use and you are only building for your
machine, just set it to your current OS X version (e.g., MacPorts
always builds this way). +
Binaries built with a target OS X version <10.7 are known to show
strange behavior in some situations on recent systems (maybe because
pass:[libc++] is standard on everything >= 10.7 and problems arise due to
mixing pass:[libstdc++]/pass:[libc++]).

Now KiCad is configured using default features/build-switches. +
See Documentation/compiling/build-config.txt for a list of all
CMake options available when compiling KiCad.

Build & Install:

  # make
    ... will take some time ...
  # make install

Again, if everything went fine you will now have KiCad binaries in
the "`bin`" folder. KiCad application can be directly run from there
to test. If everything is OK, you can create a .dmg image of your
"`bin`" folder or just copy/install the KiCad binaries and/or
support files (like demos or documentation) wherever you want.

If you resync to newer versions of KiCad you don't have to rebuild
wxWidgets or other dependencies. +
CMake should pick up the changes automatically and build correctly.
However, it is advised that you make a clean build to be sure (just
delete the build folder and go again through the configure/build
steps).
