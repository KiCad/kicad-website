The Docs Team works on writing and maintaining documentation. Documentation includes both the KiCad application and the website.

We are always looking for volunteers who are interested in contributing to the KiCad documentation project.

Most of the action takes place on two repositories on GitHub.

 - link:https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-doc[Official Documentation]
 - link:https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-website[Website]

What are the tasks we are working on?

 - Authoring
 - Screenshot production
 - Proofreading
 - Translating
 - Documenting new features

We welcome everyone who can contribute in a positive way to the official documentation. This could be any of the above mentioned points.

Simply fork the repositories linked above on GitHub and submit a pull request with changes for review.
