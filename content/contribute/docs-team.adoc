The Docs Team works on writing and maintaining documentation.
Documentation includes both the KiCad application and the website.

We are always looking for volunteers who are interested in
contributing to the KiCad documentation project.

The first thing to do before anything is to join the
link:https://launchpad.net/~kicad-doc-devs[KiCad Documentation Mailing
List].  You can also join the link:/community/irc[IRC channel] if you
have questions. Usually, there are multiple KiCad developers,
documenters and users in the channel.

Most of the action takes place on two repositories on GitHub.

 - link:https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-doc[Official Documentation]
 - link:https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-website[Website]

What are the tasks we are working on?

 - Authoring
 - Screenshot production
 - Proofreading
 - Translating
 - Documenting new features

We welcome everyone who can contribute in a positive way to the
official documentation. This could be any of the above mentioned
points.

Simply fork the repositories linked above on GitHub and submit a pull
request with changes for review.

The reference language of the documentation and the official language of
the program is English.

If your mother tongue is different from English you can still contribute
to the documentation effort translating the program and/or the
documentation.

We suggest to start translating the program. There is also a very nice
link:https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-doc/blob/master/src/gui_translation_howto/gui_translation_howto.adoc[KiCad GUI Translation HOWTO].
