== Introduction

KiCad has a variety of community supported libraries for Eeschema, PcbNew and
the 3DViewer.

All schematic symbols, PCB footprints and 3D models are organize in repositories
at https://github.com/KiCad/[KiCad] organization on GitHub.

Currently schematic symbols are grouped in libraries, a library is a set of two
files, one named with *.lib* extension and another with *.dcm*. Libraries are
generally named in such way it describes the symbols it stores, in other words, by
category. KiCad Library Editor should be used to edit symbols, however, alternatively,
files can be edited using a text editor, because they are human readable. The libraries
can be found at https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-library[kicad-library] repository.

In the other hand, footprints are placed in multiple repositories, which names
are always suffixed with *.pretty*. Similarly to symbol libraries, repository name
indicates the footprints category. Inside the repository, each footprint has its
own file, whose name ends up with *.kicad_mod* extension. As happen with symbol
library files, *.kicad_mod* files are human readable and can be edited manually,
nevertheless is recommended to use PCB footprint editor to edit/re-save files.

== How to contribute

If you want to contribute to any of libraries in any way such as adding new components
or fixing existing ones, you are more than welcome to submit a pull request on GitHub on
the relevant repository.

If you are new on GitHub, please check out this guide
https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source[Contributing to Open Source on GitHub]
before you start.

When creating/editing/fixing a symbol or footprint a set of conventions (a.k.a rules)
should be followed. They are
https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-library/wiki/Kicad-Library-Convention[KiCad Library Convention],
or KLC for short. This conventions aim to make symbols and footprints to have an
unique standard which is valuable in many aspects. Please, read KLC carefully and
make sure your pull request is compliant to. Librarians often are strictly demanding
for KLC.

Note that KLC is in such way a newcomer, this mean there are several symbols and
footprints in the KiCad repositories that are not KLC compliant yet. However,
there is a https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-library/wiki/Status-of-the-libraries[effort]
to make all libraries KLC compliant. You can also help by pulling some work is this
direction.

Always that possible take an already existing KLC symbol/footprint as example to
create/edit symbols and/or footprints. Furthermore, you can use the
https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-library-utils[kicad-library-utils] scripts to help
you to check/fix KLC issues. For more information about how to use the scripts
please look the README.md file in the repository. Is important to know that the
scripts does not cover all KLC rules, which means that if you got no issues reported
by script, this does not imply your submit will accept or that it is not violating
KLC rules.

== Become a librarian

If the 'pull request' world is too small for you, feel invited to join to librarians
team. Contact the librarians team leader by sending an email to mailing list saying
about your interest to join us.

Currently KiCad librarians team counts with just a few people against a lot pull requests
and work to do, having your help would be very appreciated.
