== Building KiCad on Linux

=== The easy way

link:http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~kicad-product-committers/kicad/product/view/head:/scripts/kicad-install.sh[This shell script] will allow you to download,
update and compile KiCad under Linux.

NOTE: If you are building on ubuntu 14.04 trusty, you
might want to add the 
link:http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~kicad-product-committers/kicad/product/view/head:/scripts/kicad-install.sh[PPA with wxwidgets backports],
this is needed if you want scripting support.


NOTE: If you are building on debian stable or similar,
not only is wxwidgets too old (minimum of wx is
3.0.0), cmake might also need an update. +
Cmake 2.8.9 (Debian Wheezy version) has a bug
and results in:

 FOUND_VAR (missing: REQUIRED_VARS VERSION_VAR) (Required is at least version "3.0.0")

At least  2.8.12.2 of cmake and newer has been
confirmed to work.

=== The step by step way

Compiling KiCAD on Linux Debian and derivatives
(Ubuntu, Mint, etc.)

This task is performed from the command-line.
Let us begin by downloading all necessary
packages.

 sudo apt-get install bzr bzrtools build-essential checkinstall cmake doxygen
 zlib1g-dev libwebkitgtk-dev
 sudo apt-get build-dep kicad

If you have trouble, you might need packages
like:

 libglew-dev libcairo2-dev libbz2-dev libssl-dev

For the webview thing, which is currently not
used:

 libwxgtk-webview3.0-dev

Also if you want python scripting, you need python 2.7 (tell me the pkgname and I will add it) and swig:

 swig

Then choose the directory where you want to build KiCad. This is normally somewhere in your home directory

 mkdir -p ~/build/kicad
 cd ~/build/kicad

Now let us download the KiCad source code from the official repository

 bzr checkout lp:kicad kicad.bzr
 cd kicad.bzr

Create a separate folder to build KiCad

 mkdir build
 cd build

Then we configure our compile and run it

 cmake ../
 make

If you have a multicore machine (for example 4 cores) you could used the command

 make -j 4

Once compiled you can optionally install KiCad in its default folder

 /usr/local

this is done with the command

 sudo make install

That is all. You now have the latest version
of KiCad installed in your machine. If, at any
time, you want to update your version of KiCad
you do the following

 cd ~/build/kicad/kicad.bzr
 bzr update
 cd build
 cmake ../
 make
 sudo make install

If you have any trouble with that compilation
then you might want to run the command
"`make clean`" before "`make install`" or
alternatively invoke cmake in a new directory.

If you want to also install the KiCad
components library, you can use these commands:

 cd ~/build/kicad
 bzr checkout lp:~kicad-product-committers/kicad/library kicad-library.bzr
 cd kicad-library.bzr
 mkdir build
 cd build/
 cmake ../
 sudo make install

Now if you want the KiCad documentation here
you go:

 cd ~/build/kicad
 bzr branch --stacked lp:~kicad-developers/kicad/doc kicad-doc.bzr
 cd kicad-doc.bzr
 mkdir build
 cd build/
 cmake ../
 make
 sudo make install
