When laying out your PCB, you can instantly inspect your design in an interactive 3D view.
Rotate and pan around to inspect details easier than with a 2D display. 
Export a realistic rendering of your project as a picture or a MCAD hierarchical assembly.

=== Kicad MCAD exporting
With kicad StepUp script, it is possible to work in *kicad EDA* with the same component model data
available in the *STEP AP214 3D format*, and obtain a 3D STEP AP214 model of the pcb board and
a complete board assembles with electronic modules, to be used for *MCAD interchange*. +
The accurate 3D visualization of components on board assembles in kicad 3dviewer, can then be
maintained in the same accuracy and aspect in STEP AP214 format, just generating VRML models
from STEP or FreeCAD mechanical models and exporting the board through kicad StepUp script. +
The kicad StepUp script maintains the usual way to work with kicad, but improves the process
to work in a collaborative way with mechanical designers bringing near ECAD and MCAD environments
thanks to the new *Kicad EDA*.
