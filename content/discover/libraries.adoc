A high quality set of EDA libraries is important to any KiCad user, from hobbyists to industry professionals. KiCad provides a set of link:/libraries/[open source, community contributed libraries].

The KiCad libraries are licensed under Creative Commons link:/libraries/license[(more information here)].

To ensure the libraries conform to a high standard, contributions to the KiCad libraries are checked against the link:/klc/[KiCad Library Convention (KLC)].

== Library File Formats

Most KiCad libraries use link:/help/file-formats[human-readable ASCII files].

=== Symbol Libraries

Each symbol library is defined in a `.lib` file, which contains multiple symbols. The `.lib` file contains the graphical description of each symbol. Each `.lib` file has an accompanying `.dcm` file which contains symbol metadata.

=== Footprint Libraries

A footprint library is a *directory* which has the `.pretty` extension. Each footprint library contains multiple footprint files, which have the `.kicad_mod` extension.

=== 3D Model Libraries

A 3D model library is a *directory* which has the `.3dshapes` extension. Each 3D model library contains model files with various extensions.

=== Template Libraries

The template libraries contain example projects for `... //TODO ...`
