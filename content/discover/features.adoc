== Eeschema

=== Schematic capture

Schematic capture is efficient, with all the tools you can expect for 
such a task. The interface focuses on productivity. There are complexity 
limits, as large designs can be divided into hierarchical subsheets.
Various export options are available (PDF, SVG, HPGL, Postscript).

=== Design Rules Check

The DRC automatically controls your schematic connections.
Check for output pin conflicts, missing drivers and unconnected pin.

=== Bill Of Materials

BOM generation is extensible via Python scripts or XSLT, which allows many configurable formats.

=== Integrated libraries

KiCad comes bundled with a vast library of symbols, footprints, and 
matching 3D models. They are community maintained so they never stop 
improving.

== PcbNew

=== Push and shove router

This modern tool will help you lay out your board faster. As you draw 
your track, it pushes forward nets that are in the way. If that is not 
possible, your track will be rerouted around obstacles. The push and shove 
router will make sure that your DRC constraints are respected.

=== Length tuning

Tune trace lengths for high speed designs with the dedicated tool.

== 3D viewer

When laying out your board, you can instantly inspect your design in an interactive canvas.
Rotate and pan around to inspect details easier than with a 2D view. 
Export a realistic rendering of you project as picture or a MCAD hierarchical assembly.
