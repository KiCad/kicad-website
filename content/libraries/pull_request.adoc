The KiCad libraries are hosted on https://github.com/kicad[GitHub] - users can submit their contributions using the *Pull Request* mechanism. Instructions for submitting a pull request are provided below.

1. If you do not have one, create an account on https://github.com/join[GitHub]
1. link:https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo[**Fork**] the repository you wish to contribue to
1. link:https://help.github.com/articles/fetching-a-remote[**Clone**] your newly created fork to your local machine
1. Create a new link:https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#branch[**branch**] in your local repository. This ensures that any local changes are not mixed with the master copy of the library until they are checked and merged by a librarian.
1. Perform any necessary modifications to the library repository. Refer to the link:/libraries/klc[KLC] for contribution guidelines.
1. link:https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#commit[**Commit**] your changes to the local repository, with a message describing the changes you have made. Complex changes may require multiple commits.
1. link:https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#push[**Push**] your local changes to the GitHub remote.
1. Create a link:https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests[**pull request**] (PR) to merge your branch into the KiCad libraries. Include links to reference documents (e.g. datasheets) in the comments, in addition to a description of the changes you have made.
1. A librarian will review the changes - discussion and further work may be required.
1. If further changes are needed, *do not create a new branch*. Simply make any further changes to the same branch, and push these changes upstream. They will be automatically added to the PR.
