KiCad StepUp is a FreeCAD Workbench aimed at helping both KiCad and FreeCAD users in collaborating with electrical (ECAD) and mechanical (MCAD) design.
Main features: load kicad board and parts in FreeCAD and export it to STEP (or IGES) for a full ECAD MCAD collaboration, 
load kicad_mod footprint in FreeCAD to easy and precisely align the mechanical model to kicad footprint, 
convert the STEP 3D model of parts, board, enclosure to VRML with Materials properties for the best use in kicad, 
check interference and collisions for enclosure and footprint design, 
design a new pcb Edge with FreeCAD Sketcher and PUSH it to an existing kicad_pcb Board, 
PULL a pcb Edge from a kicad_pcb Board, edit it in FC Sketcher and PUSH it back to kicad, 
PUSH & PULL 3D models positions between FreeCAD and KiCAD, 
ECAD / MCAD Collaboration and Synchronization, 
footprint generation even for complex pads and shapes.
