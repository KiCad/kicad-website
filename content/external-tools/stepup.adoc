KiCad StepUp is a FreeCAD Workbench aimed at helping both KiCad and FreeCAD users in collaborating with electrical (ECAD) and mechanical (MCAD) design.

Main features:

* Load kicad board and parts in FreeCAD and export it to STEP (or IGES) models
* Load `kicad_mod` footprint in FreeCAD to easy and precisely align the mechanical model to kicad footprint
* Pull a pcb edge from a `kicad_pcb` board, edit it in FreeCAD Sketcher and push it back to kicad
* Push & pull 3D models positions between FreeCAD and KiCAD
