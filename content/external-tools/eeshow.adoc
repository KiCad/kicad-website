Eeshow is a collection of programs that read schematics made by
KiCad's Eeschema. Eeshow can be used as interactive viewer, or as a
command-line tool to convert schematics to PNG, PDF, Postscript, EPS,
or FIG.

Eeshow can show the differences between two versions of schematics
sheets and it can retrieve files directly from a git repository.

Eeshow was developed as part of the Neo900 project.
