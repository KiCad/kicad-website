KiCost is intended to be run as a script for generating part-cost spreadsheets for circuit boards developed with KiCad. It works by scraping part distributor websites to get part pricing. Additionally, KiCost supports other bill of material files from other EDAs which is useful for older projects and it can even handle hand-made CSV files. KiCost also comes with a graphical user interface in addition to command line.
