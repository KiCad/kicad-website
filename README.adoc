====================

This the source for the new KiCad website, anno 2015.

== Prerequisites
You will need these packages:

- http://gohugo.io/[hugo]
- https://www.ruby-lang.org[ruby] (to use asciidoctor)
- http://asciidoctor.org/[asciidoctor]

Using asciidoctor is a requirement, because the original asciidoc
runs into trouble parsing the adoc files with TOML headers in them.
asciidoctor also has a few extra features for web pages. 

== Testing

Execute the hugo command in the repository root to build and serve the
files for development:

----
hugo server -w -v
----

Observe the console output as it will tell you the address where the
page is accessible in a browser.  The -w flag tells it to watch the
filesystem for changes to rebuild automatically. Also, the page in the
browser will autorefresh once the rebuild completes successfully.
