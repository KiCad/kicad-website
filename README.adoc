KiCad Website Source
====================

This the source for the new KiCad website, anno 2015.


== Prerequisites
You will need these packages:

- http://gohugo.io/[hugo]
- https://www.ruby-lang.org[ruby] (to use asciidoctor)
- http://asciidoctor.org/[asciidoctor]

Using asciidoctor is a requirement, because the original asciidoc
runs into trouble parsing the adoc files with TOML headers in them.
asciidoctor also has a few extra features for web pages. 

== Testing

Execute the hugo command in the repository root to build and serve the
files for development:

----
hugo server -w -v
----

Observe the console output as it will tell you the address where the
page is accessible in a browser.  The -w flag tells it to watch the
filesystem for changes to rebuild automatically. Also, the page in the
browser will autorefresh once the rebuild completes successfully.

== Adding new pages

The desired format for new pages is asciidoc(.adoc) to keep inline
with the KiCad documentation repository.  Do not use markdown even
though that is hugo's preferred format.

HTML pages are allowed if special formatting is required (i.e.
downloads page).

If the new page contains content that you cut out of some old page,
make sure the old page includes a link to the new page.  We want
people who bookmarked that old page to be able to find the content at
the new page, because http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI[Cool URIs
don't change].

There is a feature called aliases[http://gohugo.io/extras/aliases/] in
hugo, but that feature is a bit broken in hugo 0.14. See the github
issue; https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/701.

We use a workaround that is creating the file and path in the static
directory in stead, see for example the file in
static/display/KICAD/External+Tools/index.html

== Adding images
Ensure your images go into a folder in /static/img that makes sense.
General stuff can stay in that folder. Grouped content such as
screenshots, made with KiCad, frontpage, etc should go into the
respective folder (or make a new one). Try and keep image sizes
reasonable. Use JPG instead of PNG if you must to get image file sizes
if it makes sense.

== "Dynamic" content
We are using a static site generator so we do not have the ability for
scripted dynamic content.  Avoid having content that needs to be
"frequently" updated unless you are volunteering to maintain it for
the forseeable future. An example of "dynamic" content would be a list
of "recent bugs".
